All branches of cookery, without distinction, have been treated: pastry, sweet-entremets, ices, compotes, and preserves; detailed instructions have been further given, on the care and attention requisite for serving the table, as well as on the method of carving the various dishes ; a varied series of bills of fare has been also reproduced, with mention added of the wines, adapted best to the variety of dishes in a more elaborate repast. In order to simplify the arrangement of the book, a special, preliminary chapter is devoted to a collection of the elementary methods of the kitchen-work, the sundry processes, in short, which in a manner constitute the groundwork of the whole. With resources thus abundant, mistresses of families, and housewives generally, may, however little familiar with the^ 1 VI PREFACE. requirements of the dinner-table, gradually be initiated in its countless details; even the least practised cooks will be enabled, by the study of these directions, to encrease their knowledge, and be thereby fitter to conduct the operations of a middle-class kitchen. The hopes and wishes 1 indulge for the success of this work, are naturally founded on a strong desire for the improvement of domestic cookery: I would fain see it realise that most valuable progress of becoming more prefect, without thereby growing more expensive; for it cannot be denied, that, as in most othei countries, both in England and in France, vast sums are often spent with little or no profit, which, more skilfully employed, would evidently yield results incalculably more satisfactory. It is essentially the interest, therefore, not only of house- keepers and cooks, but no less of the mistress of the house herself, to become thoroughly acquainted with as well the practice, as the theory, of a simple, yet varied, wholesome at once and pleasant, style of cookery: all are alike concerned in placing thus at their disposal, always ready to consult, a competent authority on culinary difficulties: for they ought ever to bear in mind this truth indisputable, too often lost sight of, that the right ordering of the household, and the due maintenance of a good table, yield at once a double benefit, not only securing and preserving the health of the family, but drawing closer yet its dearest ties. October 1871. URBAIN-DUBOIS.Din_ex servi a. la Fraiupaise .SERVICE OF THE TABLE. In elaborate, luxurious dinners, the serving of the table is effected after one or other of two methods : the former consists in arranging symmetrically on the table, at two successive Draw. 3. times, or courses, the joints, hot or cold, or other preparations furnished by the kitchen : the other method, on the contrary, requires the dishes, each in turn, to be presented to the company at table, in the order indicated by the bill of fare.VIII THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. The two plates, which accompany this article, represent two tables, served after the two methods above-mentioned : the former being served in the order of the Service a la Frangaise, and the latter, in the order of the Service h la Basse. In the first, of these two Engravings, the first course, or service, of a dinner b la Frangaise, is found placed on table; in the second, the dessert only appears there. In family or private dinners for small parties, where the number of invited guests is limited, when therefore the whole variety provided does not suffice to constitute a regular or com- plete course of service, the method, most convenient to adopt, will be, to serve the dishes, each one after the other, whether by placing them directly on the table, or by presenting each in turn to every guest, according as the joints are whole or carved. But, between these two points, there is a nice distinction, very requisite to be oberved : when the dishes are to be set on the table, the joints may be served, without being previously carved in the dish ; whereas, if they are to be handed round directly to the company, this measure becomes indispensable; for, above all things, it is requisite, that each one be enabled easily to help himself. If the dishes are placed on the table without having been carved, they should be set before the person charged to do the honors, or, at least, whoever undertakes the carving. But the serving of the table is not confined only to the method of presenting it in detail. There are yet other considera- tions, of equally serious importance, as to which I would fain solicit the attention of all mistresses of families. For a dinner to win the approval of experienced guests, itIX SERVICE OF THE TABLE. i is not enough that it be well prepared, it must be served also, both as a whole, and in its details, with all the comfort requisite, and the attention indispensable. Whether the preparations of the kitchen are to be handed round to the guests, or deposited on the table, it is essential, that they reach the dining-room, while their acquired heat remains yet in its perfection ; for dishes garnished with sauce, especially, lose a great part of their good qualities, if they are not eaten quite hot. To obviate so great an inconvenience, then, the dishes, on arriving from the kitchen, must be placed immediately in a well-THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. X lieatecl stove or closet, while awaiting the moment, when they shall appear on table: this hot-closet must be placed in some chamber close adjoining to the dining-room (see draw. 78). If the dishes are intended to figure on the table, whether individually,, or in a combined order; they must, while waiting to be served, be set on hotwater-dishes, and kept covered. A model is here given of such a dish and cover (see draw. 3, p. vn). If the dishes are, however, to be handed round, without first figuring on table, they should remain in the hot-closet, up to the moment of entering; the dining-room. In either case, the sauces to accompany dishes, ought also to be kept in the hot- closet, whether in the sauceboats, or in small saucepans: the latter being preferable, both because the sauces thus retain the heat longer; and also, because they can be stirred with a spoon, so as to make them smooth and fluid, before being poured out, either into the sauceboat, or over the dish. When the dining-room is a considerable distance from the kitchen, it will be prudent to transport the hot dishes in a small portable liot-closet, of which a drawing is given at p. ix. It is only by using such precautions, that the risk may be avoided, of having a good dinner served in a condition so unfavorable , as to deprive it of its value, by destroying its best qualities. Next to the luxury of the viands, comes the luxury of the wines, which must by no means be neglected : good wines alone, wines old, fine, chosen with discernment, served in the best con- dition, can give to a dinner-table that stamp of real comfort, which all good hosts must ever be so jealous of maintaining. Nothing so sadly disenchants the man of taste in food, or so mars its enjoyment, as a well chosen dinner, served with illSERVICE OF THE TABLE. XI conditioned wines ; the more luxurious tlie courses, tlie more line and delicate should be the wines. In well-ordered dinners of impor- tance, the choice of wines ought to be varied, but without excess: it is chiefly, in their fineness, and goodness, their distinction must be shown ; care must be, however, taken, that the variety be not found insufficient; for the fastidious consider any dinner incomplete, which has not old madeira served after the soup, white wine with the fish, Bordeaux or Burgundy with the removes and ‘entrees’, Champagne with the roasts, and the last course generally ; and finally, some wines of more body, and higher flavor, to come in with the dessert; without prejudice, however, to the good ordinary white and red wine standing on the table. In the bills of fare, exhibited below, the wines are indicated separately, that are applicable more especially to each combination of dishes. In a house, where due care is taken, the wines ought all to be served in the precise degree of perfection, which the character of each demands. It is committing an act of culpable indifference to the comfort of one’s guests, to let wines be served to them, when shaken, thick, or not at the requisite degree of temperature. White wines, in general, served at the first, or the second course, ought to be cold ; those of the Moselle, and Rhine, require to be cooled in plain ice, that is, without salt. Claret should be served at the temperature of the dining- room, say 15° Re. — 06° Fahr. Burgundy ought to be rather cool, than warm. Champagne, is to be served more or less iced (frappe), but at any rate always caught by the action of the ice sprinkled with salt. The full-bodied and high flavored wines, which are usuallyXII THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. served at dessert, should be drunk at the temperature of claret, that is, rather warm, than cold. The dessert itself, altlio’ regarded only as an agreeable relaxation, and as the least essential portion of a dinner, is none the less of great importance: it should be plentiful, tasty, and varied. # The whole serving of the table, in a house, where comfort is the standing rule, necessitates a great variety of correspond- ing cares; for all the details are mutually dependent, and com- bine to form one connected whole. Accordingly, to serve a dinner irreproachably, before all, is required a comfortable dining-room, in every sense of the word : nothing should be wanting; neither the due measure of light, nor a certain appropriate style. To eat in a room adequately lighted, warmed without excess in winter, cool and fresh in summer, is one of the conditions indispensable for the enjoyment of a satisfactory repast. The table, at which the guests are seated to be served, ought, proportionally to the number, to be rather over spacious, than too narrow; the same also may be said of the room, in which the repast is taken: hardly any thing can be more distressing for the attendance, than the scantiness of the dining-room. Nor can any thing be more disgusting to the guests, than to be seated round a table, where, while incommoding themselves, they are constrained quite unintentionally, and unconsciously, to incommode their neighbours at the table. The table-linen, the glasses, the requisites for each cover, the porcelain or the plate, ought always to be in consistent har- mony with the style of the dinner. If the wines are choice and old, the glasses ought to be as fine. For all dishes that are notSEKVICE OF THE TABLE. XIII served cold, the plates oug'lit to be warmed. The covers ought not only to be of the utmost cleanliness, but also in sufficient number, to admit of the most frequent changes, that can be desired 5 in fact, they should be changed with every dish pre- sented. But the cares demanded .by the dining-room, should not withdraw, however, the attention of the mistress of the house, from those required by the kitchen; they should take for their starting-point this fundamental principle, that without a kitchen well arranged, judiciously supplied with furniture and requisite utensils, it is impossible either to undertake or manage any work, however unimportant. A kitchen of the middle class, where the space is almost always, more or less, too limited, may well dispense with too sumptuous an establishment; it will suffice that its arrangement, and style of furnishing, be in due proportion to the table kept, in keeping with the requirements of the house. To require culinary work to be executed in an inconvenient place, without the moderate materials befitting its results, instead of seeking the advantage of the table to be served, is wil- fully incurring difficulties without number, and of which the consequences always must be prejudicial to the service. By this brief and simple explanation, mistresses of families may form a judgment, how exacting are the rules of gastro- nomy, how much these demand, on their part, also, of prevision, forethought, and solicitude; but, in one word, it is only, on these conditions, any really good housekeeping can be main- tained.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. XIV BILLS OF FARE. The bills of fare, reproduced in this chapter, have been composed of the articles included in this book ; they are divided into two distinct series, but have not in general any very grand proportions, being applicable to dinners of only moderate numbers. The first series is calculated, if not to serve as a model in the full sense of the word, at any rate for informing mistresses of families, as to the distribution, the selection, and the number of the dishes admissible at a dinner for ten to fifteen o-uests. These bills of fare, tho’ simple and unpretending, are yet correct and varied, comprising, in addition to their own details, the dessert and the wines. The mention of the wines, that should, or may, be served with each sort of dish at a set dinner, is a novelty, which seemed useful, to remedy a sad defect, which none yet have taken care to supply. The disposition, of these first bills of fare, is so contrived, that the dishes can be either handed to the guests one after the other, or else placed on table in several distinct courses. In the second series, the bills of fare are applicable to more numerous parties of guests, and arranged on a principle different from the former : these latter are specially adapted for dinners, of which the three courses are in turn arranged symmetrically on the table: the first course includes from the fish to the ‘entrees’, neither the hot-‘hors-d’oeuvre’, nor the soups, being set on the table. The second course contains from the roasts to the ‘entre- mets’ ; the third is composed of the dessert, that is, comfits or bonbons, small biscuits, ‘petits-fours’, compotes, jellies, mar- malades, all sorts of fruit, fresh, dried, or preserved, and last of all, the cheese, and ices.BILLS OF FARE FOR DINNERS.

At p. 103, the model has been represented of a middle-class kitchen- stove (journeau), that is, a stove, neither very bulky, nor very costly, but extremely convenient: it is of iron, furnished with a boiler for hot- water, a hot-closet (etuve), and an oven ; it has only one fire-place, which may be fed either with coal, or wood; but outside the firo- place, it is furnished with an open charcoal-grating, a very great assistance in cooking. This is, therefore, take it altogether, as complete a stove as one could wish for ; but the most valuable point in its construction evidently is the way in which the fire of the fire-place is made available for roast- ing purposes; this combination is truly practical, and well deserves the best attention, both of all employed in cooking, and of mistresses of houses; for if the setting-up a spit is of itself a good step in advance, how much greater is its use, when the only question is, to make it work without the least expense, simply by utilising the fire of the fire-place itself. The roasting is effected by the aid' of a small inexpensive portable turnspit; the fire of the fire-place is laid bare, by simply letting down the plate of iron masking it, this plate being maintained in a horizontal position, by the aid of two movable iron-feet, which are fitted on to it; the fire-guard or screen is also of iron, but it can only be placed in the condition here found represented, after the plate has been let down. Attached to this stove is a broiling - machine, to my thinking the nost perfect possible, and to which I would always give the preference.XXXVI THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. The hot-closet iixed beside the stove into the thickness of the wall, is heated by the pipe of the tire-place. The hot-closet, of which the design is given at p. 121, is portable, and is intended to be placed in some room next adjoining to the dining- room, in order to keep the dishes hot, while waiting to be served. This hot-closet is constructed of tin, and heated with hot-water by the aid of either a spirit-lamp, or a small jet of gas. These hot-closets may also be heated without the aid of the water, simply by spirits of wine, or gas; but this kind of heat, which is too strong for the grating nearest to the dame, is always injurious and dangerous to the dishes, as well as for the viands they contain; the heating with water, is therefore, on all accounts, preferable. The main receptacle for water in the hot-closet, is below, near the bottom: the upper part contains another smaller reser- voir. The water is indltcred from above into the reservoirs : to one of the sides is attached a cock, serving to let this water out, as soon as the use of it is ended.TRANSLATION OP THE ARTICLES inserted in the Book; which may he useful to facilitate the Composition of Bills of fare in French.

The art of carving meat at table, consists especially in pro- ceeding with ease, free of all rude motions and impatience. Carving at table is an operation, not easy for everybody; but those who find themselves by taste, or by obligation qualified to exeicise it, must take pains, however, to acquire some know- ledge about the natural construction of complicated pieces, which they may be required to carve: I mean, those comprising many bones and joints, such as the larger sorts of poultry and feathered game; as to butcher’s meat and the greater game, or venison, a little instinct will suffice. In order to carve well at table any dish whatever, whether poultry, game, or some piece of meat of larger size, one must in the first place be seated at ease, so that one’s movements are free, that is, unhindered and hindering no one else. The piece to be carved must be placed on the dish, free of gravy, sauce, or garnish,2 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. so that it may be turned round or over in the direction most convenient. The tools indispensable for such carving are: a solid fork with two prongs, a large good knife with tine well-sharpened blade, and lastly carving - scissors. * This last instrument is of great utility. By means of these facilities, the task of carving at table is singularly simplified. As for the manner of proceeding, it depends naturally on the nature of the pieces. The essential thing, in this operation, is to know exactly the inward construction of the pieces one has to deal with, to take hold of them in their most practical direction, and lastly to distinguish nicely the most per- fect pieces, and to carve them without damaging their appetising appearance, or their gastronomic qualities: there lies the rock-a- head. This however is a plain and simple study, but a study not to be neglected; for it must embarrass the carver, and put him out entirely; if, in the course of. operation, lie is puzzled, if lie cannot find the exact point, where the joints may be divided, or if he cuts the meat in an opposite direction. Intending to facilitate this study, some descriptions will be given, as well as the drawing of those pieces, which are generally carved at table. * The carving-scissors are a great resource for those who know how to use them skil- fully. With this assistance, not only is each part divided without effort, but all are divided properly. The drawing herewith given represents an instrument of French invention, serving the combined purpose both of carving-knife, and scissors.CARVING AT TABLE. 3 1. Carving* of a capon or pullet. — A piece of large poultry, which is to be carved at the table, requires, that he, who is charged therewith, take utmost care to carve nice pieces, cutting them neatly, without rending, and of a pleasant shape, that is, neither too great, nor too small. In the carving of poultry, especially, the carving-scissors are indeed not to be dispensed with. In order to carve the poultry with facility, it must be placed on a bare dish before the carver. If the pinion-tips adhere to the wings, it is convenient first to cut them short with the carving-scissors 5 then, off the breast-piece, cut a little slice, removing at the same time/the stump (moiynou) of the fillet: this piece is very delicate, and not over-voluminous. Then out of the breast-piece is cut another fine slice, going- all the length of the breast. If the breast-piece of the fowl be very large, another slice may be taken from it, but without encroaching on the breast itself (Jiaut-de-poitrine). Having carved one side, the other should be carved without displacing the poultry. As soon as the fillets are cut, the legs are disengaged from the body by dislocating them ; yet, previously to this, the skin of the carcass must be cut just at the junction - point of the leg and back, d he operation of disengaging the leg' is managed by aid of the fork, employing the blade of the knife also. As soon as one thigh is disengaged, the leg is cut near the knuckle (using the scissors), and the thigh is then divided in two, either with the knife or the scissors, in the place traced on the drawing 6. As soon as the thighs are cut off, the breast (haut-de- poi.tr ine) is separated from the back, in order to be divided in two, either lengthwise or transversally. The back may also be divided transversally into two or three pieces, as many persons like this part of the fowl; but previous to dividing it, it must first be cut straight, on both sides, by the aid of the scissors; as with the knife the operation becomes rather diffi-THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK 4 cult, and causes a great loss of time. Besides the art of carving well, there is one condition more, the operator cannot dispense with: he must work quickly and promptly. When the guests are waiting, when all eyes are riveted on the operator, no half-measures are admissible, he cannot stop half-way, he must make straight for the point he aims at; for this reason I cannot too strongly recommend the use of the carving-scissors. If a fowl of middling size is to be carved, it may be cut first of all into four parts, disengaging the legs from the body, then the fillets, without leaving a breast-piece (Jmut- de-poitrine). Out of these four joints are then obtained eight pieces : two from each leg, and two from each fillet, by cutting them Lengthwise in the direction indicated in the drawing 8. 2. Carving of pigeons. — Young pigeons are simply divided in two lengthwise ; if they are large, the hind-part or back-half (train-de-derriere), is separated from the breast, then each of these pieces is divided in two. 3. Carving a pheasant. — A pheasant may be carved according to the method applied to large pullets, that is to say, divided in five parts. But if the pheasant is large, two fillets may be taken out of each side of the breast, leaving a breast- piece (Jmut-de-poitrine), which means the centre- part ; the legs of the pheasant may be divided in two. — Grouse may be divided, according to the same method. — The breast of wood-fowl is cut into long thin slices. 4. Carving a roast turkey. — The carving of a turkey, at table, exacts a good deal of ‘aplomb’ in the operator; turkeys being often very large, and on that very account less easily to be managed than a simple capon. If not absolutely necessary, one should not take off the legs of a turkey; only the breast is served round; this distribution may be according to two methods: the first is, carving the fillets of the breastCARVING AT TABLE. O transversally, and rather slantwise, as the drawing shows; the second is, carving the lillets lengthwise oft the breast, without making a breast-piece (Jiaut - de -poitnne) ; in both cases,, it is well, before the beginning of the operation, to disengage the pinions of both sides, leaving a small portion of the fillets adhering to them. If obliged to employ the legs of the tur- key, they are disengaged one by one, the paws are cut off at the knuckle-joint, then the meat is divided in pieces, yet leaving the drumstick whole. — The gravy served with turkey should be always sent up in a sauceboat. Draw. 9. 5. Carving of partridges. — For the carving of partridges several methods are employed; it they are young and small, they are simply divided in two lengthwise ; if large, the proceeding is, either to detach the hind-part (train de dernerd), from the breast, or divide each in three Draw. 10. Draw. 11. Draw. 12. Draw. 13. parts lengthwise, that is, cutting a part of the fillet with the leg, so that the (Jiant - de -poitrine) centre-piece of the breast adheres to part of the carcass, which is disengaged with the aid of the carving-scissors : this is the operation represented by the drawing. If the hind-part is disengaged from the breast-piece, this last must be cut in three, and brought back into place: then the partridges do not look, as if carved, as they preserve their natural shape. — Large partridges may be simply divided into four parts.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 6 6 young- guests Carving of a goose or (luck. — If the o’eese and ducks are , without any impropriety the legs may also be distributed to the but when large and full grown, it is more convenient to leave them adhering to the carcass, without disengaging them. If a goose is to be carved easily, it must be placed by the carver before himself, in the same direction as shown by the drawing. The meat of both sides must be carved in slices not too thin, that is, what are called eguillettes ,* these fillets are placed on hot plates, and basted with a little good gravy: if the geese are stuffed, a little of the stuffing is added to each of the fillets. If one is obliged to serve also the legs of the goose, they are first disengaged from the carcass, then divided into middling-sized pieces by the aid of the carving-scissors. Young ducklings may be divided simply in four parts. Draw. 14. 7. Carving a roast hare. — Off a hare is generally served nothing but the back and legs, that is, in the conditions represented in the drawing at the chapter on game. In carving this roast, two methods may be followed. The first is, transversally carving the back and legs, leaving the bones adhering to the meat; for this manner of proceeding, the carving-scissors are indispensable ; yet this method is only adapted to tender, small young hares. The second method, consists in carving both the fillets of the back in turns, into thin slices, and slantwise, there- fore of course without touching the bones; in this case, the meat of the legs must equally be cut in slices. 8. Carving a roast saddle of deer, or roebuck. — The drawing of a larded saddle of deer will be found hereafter. The dish holding the roast must be set on the table crosswise, before the person charged with the carving; the side of the ribs turned to the left, as the saddle is commenced on this side. The slices must be cut thin, slantwise, and con- sequently long: they must be served on hot plates, pouring on a little gravy or sauce, accompanying the game.CARVING AT TABLE. 7 9. Carving’ a leg of mutton. — If the leg is roasted, it can only he carved, either at the table, or in the dining-room. For carving at the table, the leg must be placed on an empty dish, turning the bone to the right or left, according to the natural direction of the leg, as the two legs off the same animal do not turn in the same direction. In both cases, the leg must be placed on the dish with the cushion turned uppermost; as the cushion is to be carved first of all, being the most fleshy part, the most abundant and the best: this thick part of the leg may be carved, after two different methods ; the first, in horizontal slices, in the direction indicated in the drawing 15; or else, in perpendicular slices, in the fashion represented by the drawing 16. In either case, the slices should be cut broad, but not too thick; also Draw. 16. they must be served on very well warmed plates, each of them basted with a little of the gravy running out of the meat when carved. If the leg is accompanied by some garnish, the latter must be served separately. — Braised leg of mutton may be carved in the kitchen, then brought back into shape, on the dish. — Quarters of lamb are carved according to the same method. Although legs of mutton are generally served with a ruffle round the bone, yet one must avoid touching it, at this side, with the hand. 10. Carving of a roast haunch of roebuck. — The drawing of a larded haunch of roebuck roasted, will be found hereafter; this being the condition, in which this roast is usually served. In order to carve the haunch, it must be commenced from the top, but slantwise, soTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKElt Y-BOOK. 8 that one can take at the same time the larded parts, and those parts of the cushion situated on the retreating part of the haunch. The roast haunch of roebuck must be served on very hot, if not on metal, i. e. pewter plates. 11. Carving a loin of veal. — A loin of veal in its shape is very much like a sirloin of roastbeef. Previous to carving a loin, the under- side {filet mignon) and kidney must be first cut off; thereupon it is set on a dish, so that the meat of the upper-side (fir os filet) may be cut in slices transversally, but not too thin ; to each of such slices, which are to be served on hot plates, is added a slice either of kidney or of under-side, as well as a little good sauce or gravy, accompanying the remove, but served separately. — If the loin of veal be carved in the kitchen, the upper side or larger fillet is removed in one piece from the bone, in order to cut it in slices transversally, and rather slant- wise ; these slices are then brought back into place ; the kidney and the minion-fillet of the loin are also carved, and ranged all round the piece. 12. Carving a cushion of veal. — Farther on will be found the drawing of a larded cushion of veal, served as an entree, on a round dish; but a cushion of veal is frequently served as a remove. In order to cut a cushion, it is sufficient to let the fork hold it fast, on the side of the udder, so as to carve the larded meat into slices not too thick. 13. Carving of hot ham. — Ham, when served hot, evidently gains by being carved at the table, this being the surest means of preserving its essential flavor. The most delicate part of ham is unquestionably the cushion, that is, the most fleshy part, indicated in the drawing by the larger number of lines. This cushion is cut in slices not over thick, the fat is left adhering to the meat. In order to carve a ham easily, it must be set on an empty dish. To each slice of ham, ranged on heated plates, a little good sauce is added; this sauce is served in a sauceboat, not on the dish. If the ham is accompanied by a garnish, this must likewise be served separately, and thus presented to the guests. If a ham is to be9 CARVING AT TABLE. handed round to the guests, garnished, it must previously be carved, and brought back into shape. — Although the bone of the ham is wrapped up in a ruffle, this is no excuse for handling it by the bone, when carving; Draw. 17. °n the contrary, one must carefully avoid touching it with the hands: a good knife and a large fork will answer every purpose. 14. Carving a saddle of mutton, braised or roasted. — In order to carve a braised saddle of mutton at the table, this piece unquestionably must be served on a dish quite hot, but mind, with neither gravy nor garnish round. In the first place, two incisions must be effected on the sides of the saddle, then the larger fillets are cut transversally in rather thick slices, avoiding to leave too much fat adhering to the slices. The drawing 18 represents this operation. But a braised saddle of mutton may quite well be carved in the kitchen, without its qualities being damaged by this process: besides, braised meat, and particularly that of mutton, is but with difficulty to be carved at the table. If the saddle be roasted, the method differs from the former; in this10 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. case, the meat of the fillets of the saddle, instead of being carved transversally, are cut in slices lengthwise (see drawing 19); these slices must be neither too long, nor too thick. To each of the slices, served on well heated plates, is added a little good gravy, coming naturally from the meat, or of prepared gravy served in a sauceboat. 15. Carving a sirloin. — Roastbeef is a piece on ho account whatever to be carved in the kitchen. This operation should be managed, if not actually at the table, enough, set upright on the bone, it not, the under-side turned uppeimost, till carved, and then turned back again. The meat is then cut in thin slices, leaving a little fat adhering to each of the slices. As each of these slices is placed on a hot plate, care must be taken to pour on a little gravy, from the meat, off the dish. If the minion - fillet of the roast-beef is to be carved, this must of course be turned over on the dish, and the meat of the fillet cut in thin slices across the ribs, along the back-bone, in the direction of the fibre of the meat, either lengthwise or certainly highly slantwise, without omitting to leave a little fat adhering to each slice, nor to add a little of the gravy. 1G. Carving the million-fillet or under-side of a loin of beef. - A fillet of beef, roasted or braised, that is to be carved at table, tor at any rate at the side-board of the dining-room; as the meat ot roastbeet will dry up and quite lose its gravy, it carved beforehand. Roastbeef may be car- ved according to two different methods, the choice of which remains a matter of taste, some persons carving only the upper-side or larger fillet of the piece, while others take the under-side or minion-fillet, first. In the former case, the roastbeef must be placed before the11 CARVING AT TABLE. distribution to the guests, must be carved well. Fillets of beef may be carved in two different methods, represented eacli by a drawing : that is to say, the meat may be carved in slices right across, in the order indi- cated in drawing 21; or else, on the slant, as represented drawing 22. For this operation the fillet must be set before the carver, crosswise; then holding it near its end with the carving-fork, cut slices off it Draw. 21. of middling thickness; beginning at the thin end, but only two or three inches from its extremity. In carving the slices, one must avoid cutting cpiite through ; that is, the cut must stop at the point called the ‘semelle’ of the fillet. If the fillet be roasted, a little of the gravy running into the dish, is poured on each of the slices. This gravy is independent of the sauce accompanying the remove, which is generally served separately. Draw. 22. In another place will be given the method how to carve a beef-fillet, when it is to be served carved ; that is, if handed round to the guests, so that they may help themselves. 17. Carving of fish. — As for the carving of fish at table, it is a generally adopted rule, not to touch, or carve them, but with silver instruments; this rule must be especially observed in regard to boiled or braised fish. Fried fish are the only ones which may be touched with a knife, and even then only the most bony ones. In order to distribute boiled fish, one employs either a silver fish-slice or trowel (truelle), or a silver spoon and fork. tTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 12 The turbot represented in the chapter on fish, indicates the direction in which it must be carved, observing to begin at the side opposite to the belly, this being more fleshy. As for carving salmon, trout, carp, or any fish of long shape, a line should be traced in the middle of the fish Draw. 23. in the direction represented by the drawing 23, that is, running from the head to the tail; then tho side of the back is divided with the spoon, and distributed piece by piece on plates. The pieces off both sides of the back are always more fleshy than those off the belly, and consequently merit preference. On the drawing, herewith given, the incisions on the fish are indicated : it has been already mentioned, that, as the meat of the uppermost part is the most delicate, these are the slices that should be presented to the guests.ELEMENTARY METHODS. W ltli a view to facilitate tlie study of cookery, as well in its whole range, as in its minutest details, I have thought it useful to classify and unite all the elementary methods into one special chapter. Let me recommend to all those who are not already initiated into the proceedings of cookery, by no means to neglect these simple methods, as they are not without importance; by passing, in the first place, thro’ this branch of study, they will spare themselves useless and fatiguing enquiries, and moreover they will be more able to comprehend the drift and import of my descriptions. 18. How to prepare garnished ‘hatelet’- skewers, to be applied to bot entrees and removes. — Garnished lhdtelets’ are of two sorts: the one cold, the other hot. Hot diatelets’ may be applied equally to entrees and removes. There is hut one difference between them; those destined for entrees being- smaller, than those intended for removes.Draw. 24. THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 14 ‘Hatelets’, for entrees or removes, are composed of truffles, cocks’-combs, mushrooms, quenelles, crayfish, or prawns, according to the nature of the pieces, to which they are applied. The materials, chosen for this purpose, must be selected for nicety of shape, and appetising quali- ties; especially they must yield an effect pleasing to the eye, by their shades of color when com- bined in forming a total: the cocks’- combs and mushrooms must be of a very clear white, the truffles very black and round. ‘Hatelets’ are mounted on silver- or Ruolz- skewers, adorned with any little subject or device on their upper extremity. 19. How to singe (flambcr) poultry and game. — Poultry and feathered game is singed in order to burn any vestige of feathers, and to remove from the skin the tips of quills that cannot be disengaged with the hands. They are singed by the aid of charcoal or of paper, also by burning spirits of wine. The flames ot charcoal and paper ha\e the inconvenience of blackening, while spirit of wine has not; therefore the last is preferable, but must be used with utmost care, lest an accident might happen. In order to singe larger poultry, or feather-game, they must be taken hold of by the throat and paws, presenting all their sur- faces by turns to the flame. As for singeing smaller game, it is traversed by a skewer. The spirit employed for singeing, must be poured into a hollow metal - dish. 20. Howto prepare garnished ‘hatelet’-skewers, to be applied to cold-pieces. — The ‘hatelets’ for cold-pieces, or cold entrees, may be 'composed with the same elements, as those tor hot removes; but the truffles, cocks’-combs, crayfish, and prawns, must all be cold; they are glazed with the paste-brush, or coated with jelly, according to t ion nature.ELEMENTARY METHODS. 15 Draw. 25. The ‘hatelets’ for cold-pieces may also be constructed with jelly; they are formed in little tin-cases, of which are given here three models. These ‘hatelets’ may be adorned either with pickled tongue, udder, poultry-fillets, or even truffles. The decoration of the ‘hatelets’ must be pierced by the skewer, which then is thrust through the case; this case is maintained at its desired height by aid of a stanchion fixed to the skewer, and by a piece of raw paste, which must entirely stop up the lower aperture of the case, by which the liquid jelly would else escape, as soon as filled in. In these conditions, the hatelets are run, in an upright position, into a thick layer of pounded ice, which is pressed together, and covered with a sheet of paper. The case being cold, it is filled gradually with very clear jelly; this jelly must be liquid, but cold. As soon as the jelly has got firm, the under- stanchion is removed, as well as the paste; the case is quickly dipt into warm water, then removed,, leaving the jelly adhering to the skewer. 21. How to lard (harder) game and poultry. — Larding (larder or harder) is inexactly used for two different ways of applying (lard) fat- bacon, Avhether to fowls or birds; either method may be so applied equally to both poultry and game; such as chickens, capons, pigeons, partridges,, and pheasants. In the former method, which may properly be called bar ding, must first of all be cut a strip of bacon, rather thin than thick, which is then trimmed square, applied on the breast of the piece ot poultry or game, and fixed on with three or four turns of thread tied separately on the side. — In the chapter on poultry, will be found a drawing representing a pullet (bar del) barded.16 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 22. How to lard (piquer) poultry and game for roast or entree. — If a chicken or pheasant is to he larded {pique); after being trussed and tied, it is singed once more on the breast-side, so as to get the meat firm. It is wiped and left to cool previous to larding. — In the chapter on game the drawing will be seen representing a pullet and a partridge larded. 23. How to bone (desosser) poultry and game. — All poultry and feather-game, that is to be prepared for a ‘galantine’, must previously be boned; but, above all, it must be slightly singed, well wiped, and plucked; then cutoff the pinions, paws, and neck, preserving the skin of the last as long as possible; the skin is now split all the length of the back, the carcass disengaged on both sides, with the aid of a small knife ; after which the stump of the wings is disengaged, so that the fillets may be reached : if poultry is boned, the minion-fillets may remain on the carcass. When the breast is disengaged, the legs are also disengaged, by dislocating the bone of the first joint, adhering to the carcass; then bone the thick flesh of the leg and the drumstick; cut the carcass, at the junction of the rump, thus to disengage it entirely from the meat; in this condition the piece of poultry or game is entirely boned; nothing remains further to be removed, but the two pinions of the wings, and the sinew of the flesh of the thighs. 24. How to truss and bring-in-sliape poultry and game. - The bringing-in-shape (hcibill&i’) of a chicken consists in feathering, plucking, singeing, drawing, and trussing it. Take a chicken in its feathers, pluck, and slightly singe it. Burn the skin of the paws, till it can be removed, by rubbing it with a cloth. In order to draw the chicken, first split the skin of the neck length- wise, and make the opening wide enough to remove the bag of the stomach; then introduce the forefinger into the hollow of the body, to disengage the interior ; manage a little aperture at the back of the neck {croupion), and remove the intestines at this side ; cut the skin of the neck beneath the head, then the neck of the chicken at the beginning of the stomach, and last of all, cut the paws to equal length. Cioss the pinions over the back.ELEMENTARY METHODS. 17 1 akc a large trussing-needle, into which insert a long string or line of pack-thread. Set the chicken on the table, rest it on its back; now, with the left hand, press both the legs, so as to maintain them of equal height {see drawing 29), then pierce i the meat beneath the bone with the threaded trussing- needle, turn the chicken on its side again, so as to run it thro' the pinions, (30) taking also the skin of the stomach; now draw the thread fast, and tie it on the side; again turn the pullet over, placing it on the back, again press both the legs with the left hand, so as to keep them ■ st^ °f equal height, and slip the trussing-needle above the bone ot the drumstick; :then turn the chicken once more on the side, introduce Draw. 29. Draw. 30. the larding-pin through the ; carcass, at the height of -he sot -l y - laisse, coming mack to the hanging end of he thread, and fastening it :see drawing 31). In these conditions, the chicken is russed in such a manner, hat both the knots are on Draw. 31. he same side; consequently the thread can be cut and removed more -asily. I heasants, pigeons, and partridges, can be trussed according to lie same method, if intended to be roasted. The trussing of poultry for an -ntree is represented later; the method will also be given of trussing snipes.( 18 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 25. How to take up fillets of poultry, or of game. - Split the skin of the breast of a chicken, remove it back so as to lay bare the fillets, which disengage on both sides with the aid of a small knife, letting the minion-fillet adhere to it, as well as the pinion. If there is but one entree of fillets of chickens to be served, it is convenient to remove the bone of the pinion; as in dishing, it occasions inconvenience. Take the fillets up, disengage the minion - fillets; place the larger fillets on the table one by one, resting them on the smoothest side, where the flesh is covered by the epidermis ; fix them with the palm of the left hand, and slip the blade of the knife between the meat and epidermis, so as to remove the latter at one pull; immediately beat the fillets with the handle of a large knife, remembering to moisten it, t them, rounding them on one side, and contriving a point on the othen Remove the inner sinew and the thin skin of the m.nion-fiflet, beat fl slightly Oil the inner surface: this addition enlaiges e . minion-fillets may be utilised, as fillets themselves ; it will suffice h ^ them slightly, to moisten them, putting them together two and two, to s;ive them the same shape as to the larger fillets. g 26 How to blanch and boil cocks’- combs. - Cocks - combs supply a very fine garnish, but only if they are cooked of a nice white. The cocks’-combs must first of all be blanched, by plunging them, a small quantity at a time, into hot water, by the ai o a s As soon Is taken out of the water, they are drained on a cloth a rubbed so that the epidermis of the surface is remove enney from the. cock’s-comb.

In any case, they must be kept firm ; as cocks'-combs over-done, lose all their qualities. 7 2,. How to roast Oil the spit. - There are several methods of roasting neat on the spit; the fire at which it is roasted may be either of coal .r charcoal, or else even of wood. In great kitchens, where larger turn-’ ng-spits, jacks, are used, wood-fire, or charcoal is mostly taken. With Draw. 32. e jacks (rStusoires) of tin (Jar-blow) and small turning-spits, mineral “ "Sed- 1 cons!der tlle 8ma11 spring turning-spit one adapted for small kitchen; it is much superior, and far preferable to the iron rack- 'd, not only because the movement of rotation is continuous, and more gular, but because it can be easily transported, and installed in every The art of roasting, whether poultry, butcher’s meat, or game, requires 3 grCatest care; especially the direction of the fire being of the first portance. One must try to feed the fire, rather on the sides, than in ' Centre> where 11 wil1 al^ays be sufficient. In the commencement of 3 °Peratl0n; the fire must be moderate, if for a large piece. Small u tr7; pigeons, and particularly small game, on the contrary, require a lZmg r® dunnS a11 t,ie time of'roasting: the intensity of the heat must ^ys e m inverse proportion to the size of the piece. One precaution,THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 20 never to be neglected, is to fix the piece to be roasted, solidly to the spi , either with thread, or by means of iron-skewers. The time requisite for roasting, can only be approximately deter- mined : this entirely depending as well on the size of the pieces roasted as on their degree of tenderness, as well as on the intensity ^^he right degree of roasting may be judged of, in poultry or game, by pressing the drumstick of the legs with two fingers; > the meat is soft to the touch, the poultry is done. When fowl is nearly done enough, the inward meat puffs out small clouds of steam. Roasts must repeatedly be moistened, either with their own fat 01 else with butter, melted in the dripping-pan. It a large piece of mealms roasting, care must be taken to avoid taking the moisture fallen to bottom of the dripping-pan : poultry and game, should only be momtened with butter. In order to prevent the roasting piece from gettm too brown a color, it must be wrapped up, either with strips ot bacon, simply with buttered paper. N 28. How to broil (griller) meat on the gridiron. Bi oiling meat or fish on the gridiron, is a very simple operation; yet is i one that needs ’great carefulness. In most of the kitchens of the middle-class here a^e handy machines for broiling on (what is called) a gridiron (ft coulisse) with grooves or slides.

With pieces of but little thickness, it is just the contrary; here the fire must be brisk and fierce. In most cases, it is very difficult to fix the time requisite for a piece to be broiled on the gridiron, whether cutlet or beef-steak; as this time does not depend only on the thickness ot the meat, but also much more on the degree of heat they are exposed to. Meat, broiled on the gridiron, must be turned only once during the time of preparation. 29. How to chop meat. — Formerly meat was chopped with knives of the shape of a crescent, uncomfortable, and even dangerous, to handle. Draw. 33. Kow-a-days little chopping-machines are more generally used, of great precision, very expeditious, and altogether giving excellent results. There are machines of different construction, and very moderate price; some are spherical in shape, and turning round, others are cylindric ; all of them produce the same results, though by different combinations: a ! smah chopping-machine is not to be dispensed with in a kitchen of the middle-class. — The machine, of which a model is here given, is of English origin: it is one of the most practical that I know of; it has a double cylinder. Further on will be given the model of a spherical machine used in France.22 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 30. How to poeler poultry. — ‘Poeler’ means boiling or stewing the meat in a fat, unctuous, slightly acidulated, white stock, having the quality of preserving the whiteness of the meat. Here is the way to prepare the cooking-stock for (white-stewing) ‘poeler’: fry, with some bacon-trimmings, onions, carrots, celery-root, and a little ham; add to this a garnished hunch, moisten with white broth, of which the fat has not been removed, and a little white wine; add the pulp ol a lemon without its peel or seeds. — Poultry that is to be white-stewed {poeU) must he moistened to height with this stock, and boiled slowly on a moderate fire. 31. How to braise meat. — ‘Braising’ the meat means, cooking it in the hot-closet, but in a good stock, so as to get it thoro’ly done, and yet to preserve its nutritive juices. Braised meat must always be well cooked ; in order to braise it, first of all, it must be placed in a stewpan with good fat or butter, and some trimmings of bacon; let the meat fry on a moderate fire, turning it repeatedly ; season it, then slip in, at the bottom of the stewpan, onions and carrots cut in thick slices, let these vegetables fry, and moisten the meat with a little broth ; set the stewpan ona brisk fire (keeping it covered), so as to let the liquid reduce to glaze, giving it a little color; moisten the meat again with a little broth, and then with a little white wine, so as to let the liquid reduce once more; turn the meat again, and lastly moisten it to height with good broth, let it boil on a very slow fire, with hot ashes on the lid of the stewpan; or else at the entrance of the oven. When the meat is three-parts done, and if it has diminished in volume, changing the stewpan is convenient, passing the stock through a sieve. ....... . If the meat is to be well braised, it is essential to avoid its boiling m either too light, or too fat a cooking-stock ; in the former case, it will not be braised, but boiled ; in the latter, it has lost its juice without acquu mg any distinct quality. If the operation has been well managed the meat when reaching the term of its cooking, ought to be found moistened to a quarter its height, with succulent good stock, reduced to halt-glaze, an of a nice color; then, instead of being dry, the meat proves savory,ELEMENTARY METHODS. 23 nutritious, pleasant to the taste, and easy of digestion. But few cooks are well versed in this operation, simple though it be. 32. How to trim and lard tender-loin (fillet) of beef. — A mi- nion-fillet, or under-side, of the loin of beef, when bought, is covered commonly with skin and fat. If the fillet is to be cooked entire, the sinewy skin, and part of the fat, must of necessity be removed ; this is what is meant by trimming the fillet. For this operation, all the fat must be removed from the top of the fillet,-from one end to the other, then the rib-bones are disengaged. The fat adhering to the side opposite the ribs, Draw. 34. is only partially removed. Now the sinewy skin, covering the upper meat of the fillet, must be removed in strips, proceeding by slipping the blade of the knife between the skin and the meat, to disengage the former from one end to the other; this operation is very simple, yet it requires to be accomplished with precision : the upper meat of a trimmed fillet must be smooth, that is, it must not be furrowed by hollows occasioned by wrong movements of the knife. The skin being removed, both the extremities of the fillet are rounded. The fat inside the ribs, on the side • • * opposite to the back-bone, is the only portion of fat allowed to adhere to the meat. The larding of a fillet is applied to its upper surface, in trans- versal, intertwined, straight, lines, operating according to the method demonstrated by the drawing. 33. How to salt meat. — The method about to be described, is the one I always practised, it seeming to me the best; I learnt it in England. In order to salt beef, or pork, as well as tongues, they must first of all be rubbed with fine salt; then they are ranged on a board in a cool place, and covered with a layer of salt; keep them thus for ten or twelve hours.24 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Boil thirty-two quarts (8 gallons) ot water, with ten pounds of salt, four ounces of saltpetre, two pounds of raw sugar; (or proportionally for sixteen, eight or four, quarts ; i- e. 4, 2, or 1 gallon) add to it some aromatics and peppercorns ; let the liquid cool. Range the pieces of meat in a tub or small cask, cover them with the souse ; place .over them a wooden round, and put a weight on this, in order to keep the meat covered by the souse ; turn it from time to time. — Proceeding thus, twelve days will suffice for salting a tongue. Fifteen days will do to salt a buttock of beef, or a sirloin : large pieces of meat must be always boned. 34. How to prepare bun dies of parsley. — The thing called in cookery a bunch of parsley, is a few sprigs of clean parsley, shaped into a faggot or bundle, bound round with thread, then cut on both ends. Bunches of parsley are commonly garnished with half a bay-leaf, and some blades of thyme. 35. How to stone and blanch olives. — If the olives are fleshy, large, and with small stones, these must be removed by the aid of a column- tube. If the olives are small, the pulp must be detached spirally fiom the stones, with the aid of a small knife, slipping the blade between the pulp and stone; if the pulp is well cut, the olive should get its old shape again, when the stone is removed. In order to blanch the olives, they must be plunged into boiling water, and immediately removed back to the side of the fire ; drain them five minutes after. 36. How to lard meat (piquer). — The art of lardipg according to the given rules, is not in the power of everybody ; it is a work of practice, but especially of attention and of taste. In order to lard (piquer) well, it is imperative to have at disposal some good salted bacon, but fresh, white, firm, and dry. Previous to cutting off the strips, the bacon must be kept on the ice, especially m summer, so as to give it more consistence ; as tor the length, and thick- ness of the strips of bacon, this is a matter of taste. It is sufficient, if they are of equal size, and of an exact squaie shape; of couise these strips must be longer, and thicker, when adapted to large pieces, than " lienELEMENTARY METHODS. 25 to small ones. The essential point is, to cut them uniform. In order to gain that end, a piece of bacon must be cut in form of a long square; when well trimmed, it is to be cut transversally at equal distances, in the order represented by the drawing 35. Then equalise it with the blade of the knife, and cut it in a horizontal direction, so as to form square strips of equal thickness. The larding-needle {lardoire), must of course be adapted to the thickness of the strips. Draw. 36. Draw. 37. In order to lard meat properly, one must be seated comfortably; take the meat on a white cloth, place it on the left knee. The larding- needle must be inserted in the meat slanting from right to left, and not straight down ; that is, the lines of larding must be arranged in regard to the look, in such a manner, that the eye can embrace their total; to be still more precise, I will say, that the meat (with respect to the person who is larding) must be placed exactly in the same direction, as it is represented by the drawing 37. The larding-needle, provided with its strip of bacon, must be inserted in the meat to a depth calculated, accord- ing to the length of the strip of bacon ; but the needle must be removed from the meat in such a manner, that the bacon remains in the flesh ; thisTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 26 strip must then be visible at both ends, without one of its sides being longer than the other. And that is precisely the thing, which can only with difficulty be obtained at the first attempt. A first line being once larded, the strips of the following one must be slipt in between those of the first, and come out just at half the thick- ness of the meat occupied by the first line; a look cast on the diawing will show this method exactly. But when these first two lines are larded, if the larding is to be continued, instead of inserting the larding-needle between the strips of the second line, the operation must be renewed at its starting-point, that is to say, two lines are larded again in the previous order, only observing that the ends of the strips ot bacon of the second division, lose themselves in the last line ot the first division. This, in short, is the theory of larding, rendered still more comprehensible by the drawing 37. The drawing 36 represents the larding needle case {etui). 37. How to chop vegetables and meat into ‘julienne’. Mincing vegetables and meat into ‘julienne’ means, dividing them m small fillets of square shape, and nearly an inch in length. These fillets should be of the thickness of a square four-sided cord. The vegetables usually cut or shred to ‘julienne’ are: truffles, mushrooms, carrots, tur- nips , onions, beet-root, cabbage, celery, and parsley-roots. One may also cut or chop to ‘julienne’, cooked poultry-or game-fillets, and pickled tongue. — For this operation the vegetable, or meat, is in the first place, cut into slices of greater length than breadth, about an inch ; then take these slices, place them one upon the other in small quantities; chisel them transversally, observing to cut the fillets just as broad, as they are thick. 38. How to prepare ‘salpicons’. — ‘Salpicons’ are prepared with cooked and cooled meat, with pickled tongue, sweetbreads, and so on; they may also be prepared with game or poultry, as well as with fat-liver, vegetables, truffles, and mushrooms. The meats or vegetables destined to compose a ‘salpicon’, are cut in dice, more or less large, according to the use for which they are intended; but in all cases, they must be as regular as possible. For this preparation the food is divided in slices ot equalELEMENTARY METHODS. 27 thickness, these are then divided into fillets, which again are cut trans- versally; this being the safest method to obtain regular dice. 39.

If the kitchen-grease (dAqvctissis de cuisine) is to be employed for frying, it must previously be purified by boiling; that is, all the aqueous parts are drained, and it is boiled until all its moisture be evaporated ; then the fat is strained through a plain cloth, in order to be warmed at the time of frying. The method of frying is very simple, yet merits being con- sidered ; altogether it consists in simply plunging the elements, destined to be fried, into the hot liquid; yet is it in practice neces- sary, to consider well the nature Draw. 38. of the substance, and accordingly, to throw them into frying-fat of more or less heat, and to fry them on a brisk or slow fire. The result aimed at is : setting well the pieces plunged in, and imparting to them a fine yellow color, nothing being less appetising than an over- brown frying. Fryings in general must be served on coming from the pan. In every kitchen two frying-pans must be at disposal ; one of them, kept clean, is preserved for fried entremets and hors-d’oeuvre ; the other, less fresh, is employed for frying fish. — The accompanying drawing represents the frying-pan, furnished with a grating (grille). 40. How to prepare ‘montglas’. — ‘Montglas’ of poultry, game, fat- liver, and sweetbread, is prepared by cutting the meat in large fillets more or less long and thick, according to their nature, and the use the montglas is intended for: ‘montglas’ indeed being only big‘julienne’. Meat of poultry, game, and so forth, which is shred or chopped to ‘mont- glas , is generally mixed with mushrooms, truffles, or pickled tongue. These garnishes are thickened with good brown or yellow-sauce; they are warmed in the ‘bain-marie’ without ebullition.2g THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 41. How to prepare flue-herbs, raw or cooked. — Raw fine-herbs include: leaves of parsley, chervil, and taragon; chives, and onions; all chopped. Cooked fine-herbs comprise: chopped shalots and onions, fresh mushrooms, truffles and parsley also chopped. In order to cook these fine-herbs, the onion and shalot must first of all be placed in a stewpan with butter, and allowed to fry without taking color; then add the chopped mushrooms ; which fry, turning them, till all their moisture has evaporated; add then the truffles and parsley, season them to high flavor, and take them off the fire. The truffles may be omitted. 42. How to prepare ‘liaison’. — Liaison is compounded with diluted yolks of eggs, and either cream or broth: previous to being used, liaisons must be passed through a sieve. 43. How to prepare liquid caramel. - Liquid caramel (brown sugar-candy), called in the kitchen monkey-gravy (Jus ie singe), is very requisite in second work; it is employed for the coloring of brown-sauces, and all liquids of which the color is thought too feeble, let it must le used sparingly, having a rough, biting, taste, which easily imparts itself to the liquid, if colored too much. For the preparation of caramel, it is sufficient to put a handful ot white powder-sugar into an earthen skillet, or into a copper one, not tinned set the stewpan on a moderate fire, stir the sugar with a wooden spoon, without leaving it, until well dissolved ; then remove it back on to a slow fire, and boil till it is quite brown, and the steam rising fiom i becomes rather white; moisten it with warm water, and boil until i ■ , f i: 0.i,4 gyrur) — This caramel should be piesen ed m the consistence ot light sjiup. , i a small bottle, shut up with a chiseled cork, so that, when the bottle is turned over, the liquid may escape, although the cork be not removed. These precautions being taken, it is easy to pour out only the quantity required. 44 How to prepare cooked marinade. - Mince one onion, one carrot, and a piece of celery, put them into a stewpan with —0^ ot bacon and fat; let these vegetables fry on a moderate fire sti till they have taken a little color; moisten with a pint of plain vmega.,29 ELEMENTARY METHODS. add thyme, bay-leaf, some sprigs of parsley, a clove of garlic, whole pepper; let the liquid boil, reduce it one third, then pass it through a sieve, and let it cool. 45. How to form quenelles with the spoon, and to poach them. — In order to form quenelles, there is wanted, in the first place, some very smooth force-meat; betaking one’s-self to a cool place, and taking a stewpan with very hot water, and two tablespoons: one of these spoons must remain in the water, the other is tilled with force-meat, which is rounded and smoothed on the top with the blade of a small knife. It must not be neglected, that the force-meat must rise above the level of the spoon; but the most important is, to give the quenelle a line shape, and to smoothe it well on the top. The quenelle being shaped, take the warm spoon with the left hand, slip it between the force-meat and the hollow of the other spoon, so as to disengage the quenelle at one pull: this is the operation represented by the drawing 39. This quenelle must immediately be slipt on the bottom of a slightly buttered saute-pan; in sa)7ing ‘slipt’, I mean, it is placed in the saute-pan without turning it over : the surface smoothed with the knife must always remain uppermost. For the poaching of quenelles, it is sufficient to cover them with boiling salted water, keeping the saucepan on the fire, till the moment the liquid starts to ebullition; then remove it back, cover it, and five minutes after, drain the quenelles, in order to dish them.30 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY- BOOK. 46. How to prepare court-bouillon. — ‘Court-bouillon’ is applied to cooking various kinds of fish. It is prepared with vinegar, white wine, or red wine, according to the species. — Mince two carrots, two onions, a piece of celery-root; place them in a stewpan with butter, let them fry on a moderate tire; add some sprigs of parsley, thyme, and bay- leaf, some peppercorns and cloves ; moisten with two quarts of fish-broth, - or simply hot water, and a pint ot vinegar. Skim the liquid, salt it, let it boil for a quarter of an hour, then pass it through a sieve, and use it. — The process is the same for ‘court-bouillon’ with wine, with only this difference, that the quantity of wine enters in the proportions ot three parts to one part of broth. These stocks are very easily to be preserved, and therefore may serve several times. 47. How to boil lobster, crayfish, and sea-crayfish. — The preparation of sea-crayfish, and lobster, is a very simple one; it consists in plunging them in boiling water, which is salted, slightly acidulated, and mixed with minced vegetables. But previous to plunging them in, the tail must be tied with thread; if lobster, the paws must equally be tied; the stewpan is shut immediately. Large sea-crayfish and lobsters must boil on a brisk fire for fifteen or sixteen minutes ; they must be left to half- cool in their liquor ; the stewpan having been removed from the fire. To boil crayfish, they are simply placed in a stewpan with salt, some peppercorns, a bunch of parsley, some minced vegetables, and a little vinegar, or white wine. The stewpan is covered, set on a brisk fire, and the crayfish are boiled for eight or ten minutes, giving them a toss from time to time. 48. How to poach oysters. — 111 order to poach oysters, they are opened, their liquor is put into a stewpan, together with the meat; the liquor is mixed with a little white wine, so .as to moisten them to halt their height. — Set the stewpan on the fire, let the liquid boil, immediately remove it back to the side of the fire; two minutes after, pour oysters and liquid on a sieve, carefully collecting the stock. Then the oysters are refreshed, spunged, and trimmed: from boiled oysters the beard and knobs are commonly removed.31 ELEMENTARY METHODS. 49. How to prepare decorated quenelles. — Large decorated que- nelles are employed as a garnish, or complement of the garnish, of removes or entrees ; they may be prepared with force-meat of poultry, game, or fish. These quenelles are formed on pieces of buttered white paper ; the shape requisite must be imparted to them by the aid of the blade of a small knife, smoothing the surface carefully. Large quenelles are commonly decorated with truffles or pickled tongue, yet truffles are preferable. The truffle-decoration can be applied to the quenelle, either previous to poaching them or after; in the former case, the details of the decoration are slightly encrusted in the force-meat, after being moistened with albumen : thus the quenelles are plunged into boiling water, but, with the paper whereon they have been formed. If the quenelles are decorated, after being poached, the details of the decoration must simply be applied, but being previously masked, or else moistened on one side with a little soft force-meat, so facilitating their being fixed. Quenelles are poached, without ebullition, in salted water. Draw. 40. Draw. 41. 50. How to parboil eels. — In the first place the eels must be killed; if they are large, hang them up by the head, cern the skin all round the neck underneath the fins, cutting it slightly, so as to be able to seize hold of it; then take it with a cloth, in order to draw it off the body of the fish. As for small eels, after having cerned the skin of the neck, it is sufficient to scald them, and then remove the skin with the aid of a cloth. 51. How to scale and cleanse fish. — Among scale-fish there are none, but sardines and red mullets (rougets), which are not generally scaled if broiled; but there are some species, for instance the sole, from which, instead of scaling them, the skin is removed altogether; it is the same with pike and carp : instead of scaling them, the knife may be slipt between the skin and the scales, which are removed by strips.32 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. There are exceptions, when fish are not drawn, such as anchovies,, sardines, and red mullets; but even in this case, it is convenient to tear off the gills. The fish, requiring to be drawn, are drawn generally from the belly; but this aperture must always be contrived, as narrow as possible. In some cases, it even proves convenient, not to open them at all, and to draw them by the gills; this proceeding being preferable, whenever it is practicable. 52. How to prepare suet-paste. — Spread a pound of flour m a circle on the table ; place in its centre half a pound of chopped beef-suet, a little salt, an egg, and two glassfuls of water; form a stiff-paste, let it. rest half an hour previous to employing it. 53. How to prepare nouille-paste. — Nouille-paste is prepared in the proportions of five or six whole eggs to a pound of flour. — The flour is strained over the table, gathered, and a cavity formed in its centre; m this hollow put a pinch of salt, five or six whole eggs, and two table- spoonfuls of cold water. Bray the eggs with the hand, gradually introduce into them the flour, so as to obtain a paste of not too great consistence; roll it on the table until quite smooth ; wrap it up in a cloth, and let it rest for ten'or fifteen minutes. 54. How to prepare puff-paste. — This paste is in tact easily pre- pared, but requires to be treated with practical skill and experience. Above all it is indispensable, to use flour of the first quality. - out a pound of good, firm, flour, well dried, and strained; set out a pound of oood, not too fresh, butter : in summer this butter may be kept on ie ice till wanted; in winter it must be kneaded in a cloth, so as to make Spread the flour on the table in a circle, pour a glass of water in the centre add a pinch of salt, then with the right hand, softly ming e the flour and water, so as to get a smooth, and soft paste, but yet ol nice consistence ; work it for but two minutes, if the paste is well prepared, it ought not to stick, either to the table, or to the hands.

Sprinkle the table with a little flour,ELEMENTARY METHODS. og on which place the paste; whicli roll out, and enlarge by beating it with the hand ; give it a square shape. Knead the butter vigorously in a cloth give it also a square shape, but smaller than the paste; place the butter on the centre ot the paste, then bring back the four sides of the paste, crossing them over the but- • ter, so that the butter may be entirely wrapped up. Take a pastry rolling- pin,* which apply to the paste with both hands, pushing forward the paste, as well as the butter in its interior. Bring the paste to the thick- ness of a tenth (or an eighth of an inch), keeping it straight on both sides : in short, just .as represented by the strip in drawing 43; now take the ■ strip at the side nearest your- • self, m order to told it at a third of its height (see drawing 44) ; press it together it by passing the rolling-pin over, and immediately fold over the 1opposite end, so as to cover the first folding. The drawing 45 represents ■ exactly the mode of the complete folding. Draw. 43. At this point, the paste has got one turn ; to fold it again it must then be given a halt-turn to the right, and then be rolled out with the rolling-pin, pushing it forwards; when as thin as at the first time, fold it , _ f r <lraW'ng f® hCre given 0f two rolling-pins: the one (46) is of French, the other ' . , ° ,erman orig'n: the latter has two movable handles at the ends, so that it is only the thicker part, which rolls over the paste. ‘ 334 THE household cookery-book again: now the paste lias two turns ; in this condition it must he left to | rest in a cool place for ten minutes; then the operation is begun anew, riving it two turns more; let it rest for ten minutes, previous to giving ,t the last two turns, always proceeding according to the first method. One obstacle carefully to be avoided, is the butter escaping from the paste; this happens, if the paste be too soft, rolled out too thin, or no rolled out regularly to a flat, that is, if it remains thicker on one side than on the other. It is not always necessary to give the paste six turns, oft n one gives it but five turns and a halt- In summer it is very difficult to get good puff-paste, without the help of ice, or a good cellar; but this inconvenience may be obviated, oy replacing the butter with beef-suet. This suet must previously be well plucked, then soaked in fresh water, well drained, and then pounded, order to be converted into smooth paste. Then some suppleness is given it, by working it in a cloth, till at the degree required. 55 How to prepare short-paste, - Short-paste is employed either to form paste-flats, or else to line the bottom of the dish for Pies' 1 ‘S prepared more or less fine, according to the employment it is intended • he more the quantity of butter is augmented the finer the pas e wd b* For paste, serving to spread inside the pie-dish . third bdf»to pound will do. — Strain a pound of flour on the clean table gatli with the hands, form a hollow in its centre; in this centre one yolk of egg, a pinch of salt, and a quarter of a glass of ate .

Whites of eggs are whipped, either with an osier-whip, or a whip of thin iron-wire* if the whip is of iron-wire, it must be noticed, that it be not recently i tinned, as the contact ot fresh tin curdles the eggs ; this being the reason, why they are whipped in an untinned basin. In order to get the whites ot eggs quite thick and frothy, one must begin whipping them gently; encreasing the vehemence of whip- ping, according as the volume aug- rments. The whites must be whipped in such a manner, that they absorb as much fixt air as possible: as it is the mingling of the oxygen with the albumen, that gives consistence to the whites of eggs. At the degree •equisite, the whipped whites must be smooth and firm; if they were graining or threatening to curdle, they nust be kept right, by adding a few drops of citric-acid, or a pinch of oowder-sugar. 5<.

Whip three whites of eggs; when firm, introduce them into the paste, but only a few minutes previous to using it 60. How to whip cream. - If the cream is to be whipt well and get light, it must be first of all quite pure, and then kept quite still. It should be left on the ice for twelve hours, then poured into a basin, decanting it and then whipped with an osier-whip. If the cream is of good quality it will become frothy, and thickish, like ‘nriringue’, in a few moments; if inferior in quality, it will remain soft, light, its volume does not augment; in this case, in order to strengthen it, a pinch of powder tragacanth-gum is mixed into it while whipping. 61 How to prepare bread-croutons. - For the kitchen, ‘crofitons of various shape are employed; those served with soups are general y cut in small dice, or else in flat rounds; those served as a garnish otrf dish, are commonly in the shape of a crescent or triangle. In order to g bread-'crouton s’ in dice, first of all cut slices of stale household-bread of the thickness intended for the ‘croutons’, trim these slices to make all four sides even, and out them in square fillets; then take these, e s small quantities, keeping them in the left hand, cut them crosswise, so as to give them the shape of small dice. In order to obtain bread- croutons of triangular shape, also cut slices of stale household-bread; divide these slices in strips about an inch long, then cut them slantwise, and m two directions, so as to obtain triangles of rather long shape, ot which th I longest side is cut straight. In order to obtain fine bread - croutons they must he fried in clarified butter, or oil; but in a saute-pan, and not in quantity of Log’s lard. 62.

How to pack up (frupper) ice-boxes (sorbetieres). — There .ire two sorts ot ice-boxes, long ones, and others of round shape, or hemispherical. The former are in tin, the latter in tinned copper. For packing up the ice-box, it must be disposed in a bucket of con- venient size, leaving space enough between the box and the wood. If a ong tin ice-box is to be packed ujj, the bottom of which is not provided Draw. 49. Draw. 50.

This ice must be copiously sprinkled with ounded sea-salt; when the ice-box is placed on the ice, it must be sur- ounded by ice well pounded, drained, and salted (ten pounds of ice squire three pounds of salt) ; arranging the ice in layers pressed quite lose. But although the ice is salted previously, yet each layer must be prinkled with salt, this being (it must not be forgotten), the chief auxiliary to the congelation : the ice alone, without the salt, may cool the weetened liquid, but can never, alone, bring it to congelation. I he drawings’' joined to this article represent, firstly (49) the ice-box i its bucket, resting on a pivot, and surrounded with ice; in the second lace, (50) a pallet for taking up the ice, which may be in wood, or ictal, but in any case perforated, so that the water contained by the ice an be drained. The third drawing (51) represents a pestle for com-THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY- BOOK. 38 pressing the ice between bucket, and ice-box; this pestle is in massive wood, square at one extremity, and round at the other. 64. How to prepare ‘dor nr e\ — The material, usually employed in the kitchen for giving the surface a golden or yellow color, called ^dorure’, (or egging,) is composed simply of well beaten whole eggs, 01 else with yolks of eggs diluted with a little water. 65. How to prepare bread-crumb. — In the kitchen two sorts ot bread-crumb (panure) are employed, the one dry, the other fresh; the latter is especially applied to the preparation of cutlets, fillets, and fried fish. Dry bread-crumb is prepared with remains of bread, put into the hot-closet in order to dry, then pounded and passed through a colander. Fresh bread-crumb is prepared with stale household-bread, the crumb of which is rasped. This bread is also passed through a colander. 66. How to fry parsley. — Fried parsley is frequently employed to garnish fried dishes ; this is properly no garnish, but simply a decoration. In order to fry parsley, in the first place, the leaves must be disengaged from the stem, then washed, and well drained. They are plunged in hot hog’s-lard, and drained immediately when stiff. 67. How to pack up (frapper) moulds in ice. - Moulds are packed up with simple ice, or else with salted ice. In the former case, it is sufficient to pound the ice, put part of it into a basin, and set the mould thereon. If the mould is provided with a cylinder, this is first filled with little pieces of ice, then the remainder is placed all round the mould. Moulds are packed up in salted ice, when they are to be filled with preparations of plombiere or mousse. In this case, the ice must be pounded, the water is well drained previous to salting it, then it is spread in a layer on the bottom of a bucket; on this layer then is set the mould carefully shut, which is surrounded with the remainder ot the ice, care- fully pressed together. The mould once filled with the preparation destined for it, and the junctures being cemented well with butter or raw paste, sprinkle over a little salt, and cover it entirely with salted ice. 68.

For coloring soups, nothing else ought to be used but v spinach-green. 69. How to salamander. — ‘Salamander’ is the name of a round flat piece of iron, fixed to a handle likewise of iron. With the round part of Draw. 52. this red-liot iron, is glazed the surface of any food (mets), dredged with sugar or bread-crumb. But it no salamander be at hand, this glazing may be operated with a simple office-shovel, the broad end of which is made red-hot. 70. How to cleanse almonds and pistacliioes. — In order to remove the skin from dried almonds and pistachioes, it is sufficient to plunge them into boiling water, and keep them on the fire till the skin will disengage itself by the pressure of the fingers ; at this degree they are Jiained on a sieve, to be blanched without delay, and then refreshed. 71. How to breadcrumb (paner). :— The process of breadcrumb- ing (paner) consists in wrapping-up the substances with a crust, formed by dry or fresh bread-crumb ; but in order that this bread-crumb may adhere to the substances, the latter must have previously been dipped into beaten eggs, or at least into melted butter. For the breadcrumbing of cutlets, fish- or poultry-fillets, it is sufficient to dip them in beaten eggs, drain them, and lay them on the breadcrumb : fish-fillets are frequently floured previous to dipping them into beaten eggs. But in order to bread- crumb those substances which need a solid coating, they must first be rolled in bread-crumb, then dipped into eggs, and again breadcrumbed.40 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 72. How to infuse zest. - The zest of lemon, oranges, and other fruit with peel, is removed by the aid of a small knife, carefully avoiding to take the white pith inside the peel, which is always of a hitter taste. In order to perfume syrup with zest, it is sufficient to let it macerate tor twenty minutes in the liquid, which must be quite cold. Then the syrup is strained. 73 How to filter fruit-inice. — Orange- and lemon-juice are those commonly filtered. They are filtered, either through a china- or glass- funnel, provided with filter-paper; or else, by the aid of paper free of lime braved, washed, converted into paste, then spread in a tlun layei on a sieve. For the filtering of gooseberry-or raspberry-juice m great quantities, a felt straining-bag must be employed, disposed in the manner represented by tlie drawing 59. 74 How to perfume orange- or lemon-sngar. - The best method of perfuming sugar, consists in rubbing the zest of the fruit against a piece of loaf-sugar of rough surface. The surface of the sugar is grated as soon as moistened and colored by the zest. Then the sugar is crushed with the blade of a knife. 75 How to turn and boil mushrooms. - Comestible mushrooms are those generally employed for ldtohen-use; they are the best auc finest - besides they offer the great advantage of never being mjuuous, !X; as they are but fresh. In order to prepare the mus rooms, they must be chosen of equal size, fresh, quite firm, and above all not openei. - Cut off the ends of their stalks, quickly refresh the heads or buttons, then take one of then, with the left hand, and with the point of a small knife remove the skin, covering all the upper surface of the muslno , - head turning the latter round the blade, which remains fixed in g hand. The essential point is, to get the surfaces as smooth as poss, e. As the mushrooms are turned, throw them into a stewpan, 10 < mg a melted butter, mixed with a little water, the juice of some lemons, and a pinch of salt. In order to boil these mushrooms, it is sufficient to gn the liquid two or three minutes’ ebullition, but keeping the stewpan coverec.41 ELEMENTARY METHODS. — VEGETABLES GARNISH. 76. How to cut vegetables with a spoon. — Carrots, turnips, celery- roots, beet-root, and potatoes, can be cut to the shape of balls or olives, by the aid of a vegetable-spoon or scooper, somewhat in the style of those, represented by the drawing. These scoopers may be round or oblong, • uniform or channeled. Vegetables intended to be cut with this scooper, must previously be peeled ; balls or olives are scooped, by introducing the sharp part of the scooper into the thickness of the vegetable over its whole surface : whether balls or olives are wished for, pains must be taken to disengage these parts as whole and intact as possible. Draw. 53. Draw. 54 77. How to prepare ‘macedoine’ and ‘jardiniere’ of vegetables. — macedoines and ‘jardinieres must not be confounded; either having its paiticulai character. A jardiniere is composed of fresh tender roots and vegetables, either whole, or divided in very distinct parts; it k may comprise: carrots, turnips, colewort, celery-root, french- lilk i beans, Liussels-cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, small onions, heads of asparagus. Large roots, as carrot, turnip, celery, and so forth, are turned to balls with the aid of a channeled knife, or cut with a large vegetable-spoon ; the cauliflower and broccoli are divided in floAM ets ; the french-beans cut in lozenges, or minced. These vegetables are boiled separately, or else simply blanched in salted water, preserving their color; they are specially employed as a garnish of large pieces; most commonly they are dished in groups. Ihe macedoine’, on the contrary, is composed of small vegetables, cooked separately, but mixed together; it may be Draw-55- composed of carrots, turnips, or other roots, green-pease, french-beans, kidney-beans. The large roots are cut to balls either oblong or round, and either with the aid of a vegetable-spoon with the machine, or else Wlth tubes from the column-box. These vegetables are blanched separately in salted water; some of them, the firmest, may be boiled with broth, and then glazed; in any case, they are all at length mixed together42 the household cookery-book. in a buttered saute-pan, tossed on the fire for some minutes, seasoned with salt, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar; at the last moment, they are thickened with a little reduced good bechamel - sauce; the ‘macedoine may be served, either as a garnish of large pieces or entrees, or as a vegetable ‘entremets’; in the last case, it must be garnished with cron- tons’ in puff-paste or bread, fried in butter. 78. How to blanch vegetables. — Blanching vegetables, is plunging them into boiling salted water, to boil them more or less long, accoiding to their nature, yet without boiling them too soft. The more difficult the vegetables are to soften, the more must the blanching he prolongs. 79. How to cleanse and boil fresh truffles. - The fresh truffles purchased in the market ore commonly very earthy ; in order to cleanse them, they must be put therefore into water, and nibbed with a brush over the whole surface, but especially in all the cavities. They must e left in water as little time as possible ; when they are drained, take them once more one by one, in order to remove all earthy parts that had resisted the brush, with the point of a small knife. Immediately, as eac i of then, is cleansed, the truffles must be shut up m a stewpan so as better to preserve their aroma. Truffles may be boiled, either peeled, oi with their peel on; if boiled with their peel, they must be placed in a Stewpan not too large ; salt them slightly, and mask them with strips of bacon; then moisten them to nearly their height with white wine: madeira or champagne. Truffles must be boiled in a covered stewpan, and on a brisk fire; yet great care must be taken not to coov tiem oo on nothing being more disagreeable than a truffle overdone ; which loses al its qualities : seven or eight minutes’ ebullition will suffice to b the largest truffles. If the truffles are peeled, they must be boiled with little wine and a little good meat-glaze. 80. How to glaze small onions. - If importance is attachedl to getting the small onions well colored, they must not be blanched t y must only be fried in butter, or lard, and a pinch of sugar; moisten them to height with broth, letting this reduce to glaze.

How to pass purees through the tammy. — Generally one passes through the tammy purees of vegetables, poultry, and game, which aie to serve as soup or garnish. The tammy is preferable for this reason, that the purees are more smooth and less grainy ; moreover because the sieve has the inconvenience of dropping sometimes horse-hair into the purees. The passing of purees requires two persons ; each of whom takes hold of the tammy on one side, the purde is poured on the hollow formed by the tammy, then by the aid of two wooden-spoons, the bowls of which touch one another, a violent pressure is exerted, so that the puree falls into a vessel placed on a stool. The whole success of the operation depends on the regular motion of the spoons, which must recede and advance together, without ever separating from each other.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 44 82.

How to prepare gravy. — Even in small kitchens, gravy is an auxiliary not to be dispensed with. The method of preparing gravy, according to the rules most approved, is prescribed art. 169 ; it seems well however, that a simpler method should be also given, better adapted to the working and requirements of a middle-class kitchen. Butter the bottom of a stewpan proportioned to the quantity ot meat; this is composed of trimmings of beef and veal ; the pieces must not be too large; put them into the stewpan with some minced onions, carrots, celery - roots ; set the stewpan on a moderate fire; turn the meat repeatedly, so as to impart color to every part of its surface ; when it is of a nice color, moisten it with a little common white wine, which let reduce to glaze; moisten then the meat to its height with light broth; add to the liquid some aromatics, some trimmings ot raw poultry, or some roasted carcasses; skim it carefully, and at the first bubbling remove it back to the side of the fire, so that.it may boil but partially. When the meat is done, skim the fat off the gravy, pass it through a sieve, or a napkin, into a large kitchen-basin ; let it settle, clarify it, let it reduce till it be succulent, or else employ it as it is. 126. How to prepare game - extract. — Spread a stewpan with minced vegetables, and some slices of raw ham ; on this, layer place a few raw body-bones of partridge, or pheasant; moisten to quarter their height with broth, which quickly reduce to glaze; this done, moisten the meat to cover, also employing broth or jelly-broth; start the liquid toTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-HOOK. 56 ebullition, add to it a bunch garnished with aromatics, then whole spices, and two glassfuls of white wine; carefully skim the liquid, give it an hour’s ebullition, skim off its fat, pass it through a napkin, let it set, and decant it; then clarify it with a little chopped raw game-meat. 127. How to prepare meat-glaze. — In order to prepare good meat- glaze, one must have at disposal a sufficient quantity of broth, as white, as fresh, as pure as possible, and free of fat; pour it into a large copper stock-pot {see drawing 66) ; mind, the stock-pot can be filled to half its height only. Set this stewpan on a brisk fire, let the liquid boil, being careful to leave in the vessel a ladle, so as to prevent the liquid’s flowing over the rim. When the broth has partly evaporated, that is, when three- parts reduced, when of fine color, and slightly thickened; change the stock-pot for a smaller one, which then set on the side of the fire, so as to bring the. glaze to the required degree of consistence, clarifying it, that is, removing the impurity gathering on the side opposite to that whence the ebullition starts. With these precautions, a fine pure glaze is obtained. The glaze is sufficiently reduced, when it has acquired the consistence of syrup; at this degree it should well coat a spoon, when dipped into the liquid. » 128. How to prepare poultry-extract. — Poultry-extract is obtained quite naturally from the cooking-stock of poultry passed through a sieve, set, and decanted. This extract is also produced by clarifying poultry- broth or stock with meat of poultry, proceeding by the same rules as for a jelly-broth. 129.

A sauce thickened with eggs, must ilways be passed through a tammy, or a tine colander. 137. How to pass sauces through the tammy. — What in kitchens s called a tammy, is a piece of unbleached woollen cloth, supple and a y ■ittle thick-set, cut to a length of about twenty-five or twenty-six inches, >y twelve or fourteen. In order to pass a sauce through the tammy, two leisons aie required ; each taking hold of one end of the tammy, and .'laving poured the sauce into it, twisting it in opposite directions, so as o squeeze or pass the sauce thro’, dropping it into a vessel or stewpan.

How to reduce sauces. — If a sauce is reduced, it is in order :to finish and get it succulent; it is requisite then, to have at disposal some .good poultry- or game-stock, to add to it; the stocks which are to be added to sauces, must be concentrated as much as possible, in order to avoid unnecessary work. To reduce a strained sauce, the fat of which is Draw. 61. kimmed, pour it into a narrow-bottomed saute-pan, and boil, stirring it .radually; add to it the stock, which is to improve it, and keep on a ' *gorous ebullition, without leaving off stirring the sauce with a flat iron- poon, thus avoiding its sticking to the bottom of the saute-pan. When tie sauce is sufficiently reduced and aromatised, it is passed through a ammy (see drawing 60). The drawing, herewith given, represents the peration of reducing sauces, into a flat stewpan.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 141.

Pectoral-broth. — Singe and draw a good fowl, divide it in quarters, which put into an earthen stock-pot; add to them the body-bones, pinions, paws, and crop, all well cleansed. Cover the meat with three or four.quarts of water, add a small quantity of marsh-mallow or althea- root, and two handfuls of best pearl-barley, washed ; set the vessel on the lire, skim the liquid, boil the meat quite gently for three hours ; then pass the broth through a cloth. This broth is especially served at spring-time, being both stomachic and refreshing. 213. Stock-pot and broth. — A stock-pot (called in France the pot- au-feu) is so well known through ail parts, that it must be held super- fluous to give a minute description thereof; I shall content myself there- fore with practical considerations calculated to simplify the operation, and at the same time, to contribute to ensuring its perfection. The bioth of the stock-pot must boil either in an earthen, or cast- iron vessel; the beef employed must be fresh, of good quality : meat long- kept or of inferior qualities, giving bad results. When the broth of a stock-pot is prepared with the view to serving the beef after the soup, it is convenient to employ a slice of rump of beef (culotte), preferably to an> other part ot the ox, this piece being the most delicate, when boiled. In ordinary circumstances, beef alone, associated with good vege- tables, is sufficient for the preparation of a stock-pot; but to obtain a moie delicate, and succulent broth, there should be added to the beef a good fowl, or a small knuckle of veal: veal and fowl may also be ad- vantageously combined. The choice of the vegetables employed, is not without influence on the goodness ot the stock-pot; carrots and leek are not to be dispensed with; when the turnips, celery, and parsnips, are not of too strong an aroma, they may be admitted, yet not to excess, especially the celery. An onion, nicely colored, or so to say baked in the oven or in hot ashes, is not only necessary in order to give the broth a fine color, but it helps also to improve it. Cabbages must previously be blanched. The proportions, of meat and water, are, five pints to each pound of meat. \ et is it a point to be remembered, that not every water is good;THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 84 that employed for kitchen use must be pure, clear, and limpid ; hard water is quite unfit for cooking purposes. _ The process for cooking broth is one of the greatest simplicity, rat in this very simplicity is found the difficulty. In the first place the water, meat, and salt, are placed alone in the pot; which is set on a mode,ate tire so that the skim or scum rises gradually to the surface ot the liquid: broth not well skimmed at the outset, will never become cleai, am always preserves a taste of albumen, that is very disagreeable. As soon as the ebullition begins, the pot must be removed to the side of the fire, so as to present only the least possible surface to the action of the tire (see the drawing 08); by this means the liquic, joi ing ju partially, does not become troubled, but remains limpid: 111s is mystery of the operation. In great kitchens, the cooking of the stock-pot is managed with gas- . ,1 The introduction of the other meat, and of the vegetables into the pot, must take place in regular order. The knuckle ot veal may be in 10- duced at the same time as the beef, but then it must be watched, and removed as soon as done. The fowl should be introduced into the pot at the same time with the vegetables, yet these vegetables themselves are not introduced all at a time : those wanting longest time to coot, aic first the others following; the true theory consists in aiming at important result, that all the meat, and vegetables prove done at the sam time, and be done nearly at the time of serving the stock-pot. A stock-pot takes from five to six hours cooking, according to the size of the meat, taking care, however, that neither meat nor vegetables C°0kTli°e’stock-pot, in its true expression, represents nothing but the soup of the day, that is to say, that the broth, produced by it, is specia y “d to prlpace the variety ot preparations - Je H J?

It is not necessary, that this broth be very succulent, it is sufficient, if it be clear and abundant.

Gourmets’ stock-pot. — Draw and singe a good fat fowl; fill the body and breast, with sausage-stuffing, highly season this force-meat, H and finish it with«n little chopped parsley.86 the household cookery-book. Cut square a piece of brisket or rump of beef; in the former case, the meat must be boned, and tied up with thread. Put this meat into an earthen pot with a bone of veal, and those of the beef, four or ve quai s of water, and a little salt; skim the liquid, remove it back to the side the tire. Two hours after, plunge the fowl into the pot, as we as carrots, one turnip, a large onion studded with cloves, and larily one leek tied together with a lettuce, and a pinch of chervil; le the q boil gently, until meat and fowl be done ; remove the towl, .1 done bctoie the beef; pass the broth through a napkin, pour two quarts into a stew- pan, without skimming its fat; add to it three quarters of a pound rice, and a pinch of saffron, remove it to a moderate fire so that the may boil gently, adding some broth, if it become too thick- ™he rice is done, the broth, although consistent, yet must be more liquid than , -risof • in short, the broth must be visible. At serving-time, pom soup into the tureen; dish the beef, surrounded with part of the vege- table. from the pot; serve the fowl separately, masked with a little curry- sauce. s ‘>15 Beet' jelly-broth, with vermicelli. — Take a pound of lean beef divide it in small square pieces, chop it; put it into a stewpan, an< mix’in one whole egg, dilute it with two quarts of good cold broth, w |ts fat skimmed off, and decanted; add to it a little minced carrot, a piece of leek another of celery-root; stir the liquid from time to time , at first bubbling, remove it back to the side of the fire ; fifteen or twenty minutes after, it must be clear and relishing; pass it then tluoug i a w napkin, disposed in a filter-bag (see drawing 69).

Set the stewpan on a moderate fire, clarify the broth, proceeding as said in the article 215. Butter a small charlotte-mould, mask the bottom with a round of paper. Whip three whole eggs, and eight yolks of eggs in a basin ; add a little salt, a pinch of sugar, another of nutmeg. Dilute these eggs with one glass and a half of good milk. Pass the preparation through a sieve, pour it into the mould, and let it poach in the ‘bain-marie’, taking care not to let the water boil. When the preparation has got firm, leave it to cool for two or three hours. At serving-time, turn the cream out, divide it in little squares, which put into the tureen ; then pour the jelly-broth over, having passed it through a sieve, and skimmed its fat. 217. Hoav to strain jelly-broths (consommes). — In order to strain the jelly-broths without any danger, a napkin must be fastened to the four feet of a simple bottom- less stool, set on the table. Place a kitchen-basin underneath the napkin, in order to gather the strained liquid (see drawing 69) ; pour then the jelly- broth on the hollow of the napkin, with the aid of a great ladle. This is one of the'simplest of operations. 218. Jelly-broth, with spring vegetables. — Prepare two quarts of jelly-broth of veal or poultry (see art. 215); keep it covered at the side ot the fire. Cut round some dozen tender small carrots ; if they are large enough, divide them; blanch them in salt-water, drain them, and finish cooking them with a little broth, which let reduce to glaze. — Cut some tender small turnips to balls, as well as a stick of celery, and a small cucumber. Let these vegetables be blanched separately; let them glaze with a little good broth, and a pinch of sugar. — Blanch two handfuls ofTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK 88 small green-pease, as well as a piece of cauliflover, divided into flowrets, and some white asparagus-heads ; put all into the tureen.

When the colewort is nearly done, add the blanched lettuces, and raw sorrel-leaves. Poach in acidulated water, eight or-ten very fresh eggs (see, in the Chapter on Vegetables) ; trim them, and place them in a hollow dish. At serving-time, skim the fat off the soup, pour over the eggs a little clear good broth; serve them together with the soup. — A ‘julienne’, prepared in the simple tashion here described, is to be considered, as an excellent soup ; but to give it a little more distinction, it should be prepared with good jelly-broth. ‘Julienne’ soup may be served in its natural condition, that is, without the addition of any garnish.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 90 223. Julienne-soup with vegetable broth. — Cut in fillets: carrots, turnips, celery-roots, leaves of lettuce or sorrel, leek and onion. Fry these vegetables with butter, proceeding as said, in art. 222; when the moisture of the vegetables is evaporated, moisten them with fish-broth or vegetable-broth (two quarts). An excellent vegetable-broth can be pre- pared with two handfuls of dry pease, one handful ot dry mushrooms, and five pints of water; if no fish- or vegetable-broth be handy, the ‘julienne’ may be moistened, with equal parts of boiling water, and of the cooking-stock of dry haricot-beans, or ot lentils. Yet an excellent broth can be obtained, by moistening the vegetables with a light puree of pease or dry haricot-beans. In every case, the soup must be well seasoned. 224. Rice-julieime-SOiip. — In the shops, a dry preparation is found composed of vegetables, and rice in small grains (en sernoule) like semo- lina. With this mixture, a good soup is obtained, that can be prepared in a few minutes. It is sufficient to drop the rice into the boiling liquid one spoonful is required for each person. Every body knows the ‘juliennes’ preserved dry ; this method is .excellent in its principle, giving every one the possibility of having goo vegetables at all seasons, and in everyplace, either it fresh vegetab es are lacking, or if they are bad; but it is well to state, that the preparation of these vegetables is by no means as careful as it ought to be, and that its result leaves much to wish for. 225. Brnnoise-soup. - Take the same vegetables, and roots, as to a ‘julienne’: carrots, turnips, celery-roots, onions, and leeks. Cut these vegetables, with a small tube of the column-box (see D™ 72)• of carrot only the red part is taken. If the vegetables are not tender, blanch them for I few minutes; yet it is to be preferred to operate with raw, bu“;;^t onion and leek, add to them the other roots, sprinkle over a little salt, and a tablespoonful of sugar. tenie \ eg tables have reduced all their moisture, moisten them with a g.ll ot good91 BRUNOISE-SOUP. broth, which let reduce ; then, moisten them thoroughly with two gills of fresh clear broth passed through a sieve, and its fat skimmed off. At the first bubbling of the liquid, remove the stewpan back to the side of the tire ; keep it thus for an hour and a quarter: : the vegetables must boil, without however t being converted into puree. Some minutes [ previous to serving, mix into the soup two tablespoonfuls of tender lettuce-leaves, cut and blanched in salt-water ; add four or live tablespoonfuls of rice, barley, or any paste, cooked. Skim the fat off the soup, previous to pouring it into the tureen. — The 'bru- noise’ may be prepared with jelly-broth ; it may also, like the 'julienne’, be prepared with fish- or vegetable-broth. 226. Spring-soup, with vermicelli. — Set on the lire a stewpan with three or four quarts of water. Pluck, wash, and then put by, some tender turnips, trench-beans, carrots, and fresh potatoes, half a crisped colewort, two or three green pumpions, a slice of gourd, or Spanish artichoke, a ■ small head of cauliflower, a handful of tender beans, and the same of .gieen-pease. It is not strictly necessary, to employ all these vegetables 'at once, if only the species be varied, being content with those the season provides best, and most tender. When once the vegetables are tough, one can not venture to serve this soup. The vegetables being plucked, divide the largest, leave whole the small ones , wash them, drain them on a sieve, but separating the various species. The leaves of the colewort must be torn in pieces, the cauliflower is divided into fiowrets, the turnips, and potatoes, are cut in small quar- ters; the pumpions, and Spanish artichokes in large dice, the french- beans m little pieces, the beans, green-pease, remain in their natural condition. AY hen the water in the stewpan begins to boil, salt it slightly, then in turn, add to it those vegetables requiring longest cooking, and succes- sively the more tender ones. As soon as the last vegetables, that is to say. Draw. 71 Draw. 72.92 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. a those, which require least cooking-time, are immerged, mix into the soup eight or ten ounces of vermicelli; cover the vessel, and let the liquid boil for ten or twelve minutes more. At serving-time, thicken the soup with ‘liaison’ of six yolks of eggs, mixed with grated parmesan, and diluted with a little cream. 227 Turnip-soup. — Peel some good turnips, then with a vegetable- spoon cut them into little halls of the size of a large pea; throw them into a stewpan of tepid water.

Carrot-puree with rice. — This puree is an excellent one, but is generally badly prepared in the kitchens of the middle - class: one must never forget, that its peculiar character is, to be of a fine color, very smooth, and sufficiently thickened. I will indicate two methods, being equally practical. Take a pound, or a pound and a half, of the red part of fresh, tender, odoriferous carrots, which mince; place them in a stewpan with a piece of butter, a little salt, and a pinch of sugar. Fry them until all their moisture be reduced; then moisten them with a little fresh broth, coverPUREE-SOUPS 115 the stewpan, and remove it back to the side, on a moderate lire; boil the vegetables short of moisture, stirring them from time to time. On the other hand, peel two or three potatoes, cut them, and boil them in salted water. When done, drain their liquid, cover them, let them dry for a few minutes at the entrance of the oven. — The pulp of the carrots being done, mix into them the potatoes, pass all together through a sieve. Put this puree into a stewpan, gradually dilute it with two quarts of fresh broth, let the liquid boil, stirring it; immediately remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire; boil the soup for twenty- five minutes, season it, skim it, thicken it with a liaison of three yolks of i immediately pom it into the tureen, passing it through a fine sieve; add to it four spoonfuls of boiled rice. — This soup may likewise be prepared, replacing the broth by milk. Heie is the second method. Boil the red pulp of the carrots, ex- actly as indicated above; when at the degree requisite, they must be of a tine red color: pass them through a sieve. — On the other hand, melt a piece of butter in a stewpan; mix in two tablespoonfuls of flour, and foim a little roux ; try it on a moderate fire for some minutes only; dilute it then, off the fire, with two quarts of broth ; stir the liquid on the flic, let it boil, remove it back to the side of the fire ; twenty-five minutes aftei, skim off its fat, and mix into it the carrot-puree; season the soup, boil it for a quarter of an hour more, pour it into the tureen, passing it through a sieve. — With this soup may be served little bread-'croutons’ fried with butter. 285. Puree of dry vegetables, for soup. — Lentils, white haricots, yellow pease, and split pease, are frequently employed for the confection of soups, particularly in winter-time. These purees are easy of execution, and, if carefully managed, yield very good results. In order to prepare these purees, these vegetables must be boiled in salted water, with some fresh vegetables ; they are drained, and passed through a colander or sieve. Now place the puree in a stew-pan, and dilute it either with good broth, or else with the strained cooking- stock of the vegetables ; the soup being diluted, let it boil, stirring it withTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 116 a spoon, so as to prevent its sticking to the bottom; remove it then back to the side of the fire, and let it boil only partially ; in this condition it clarifies well. — Soups of vegetable-puree may be always thickened, and associated with any garnish. 286. Poultry-cream, a la brunoise. — With two or three quarts of poultry-broth, prepare a little stock for thickened soup, of a yellow color (see art. 246) ; let it clarify at the side of the fire for thirty-five or forty minutes, whereupon pass it through a tammy; put it back into the stew- pan, let it boil, and thicken it with six tablespoonfuls of poultry-puree, mixed with three yolks of eggs, a little good raw cream, a small piece of fine butter; keep the soup in the ‘bain-marie’. On the other hand, prepare a little garnish of tender vegetables, cut in small dice, or simply with the machine; these vegetables are composed of: carrots, turnips, and celery-root; blanch then separately, let them glaze with a pinch of sugar ; at serving-time, mix them in the soup ; add some spoonfuls of blanched green-pease ; pour the soup into the tureen. 287. Fish-stock for thick soup. — With five ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, prepare a ‘roux’ (see art. 135) without allowing it to take color; dilute it then with four quarts of clarified fish-broth.

Fish-soup, with leek. — Cut, in thick pieces about an inch long, the white part of some well washed leeks ; split them in the middle, shred them to ‘julienne’ lengthwise; fry them gently with butter, till they be of a yellow color; salt them, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, moisten them with three quarts of fish-broth, passed through a napkin; let the liquid boil, stirring it with a spoon, immediately remove it back to the side of the fire, so as to modify its ebullition. Twenty-five minutes after, skim the fat off the soup, add a pinch of pepper, a little nutmeg, two dozen bread-quenelles, prepared, as indicated in the chapter of vegetables, poached in water; pour it into the tureen.BARLEY-, AND POULTRY-, CREAM-SOUPS. 117 289. Barley-cream. Barley-cream, is one of the most stomachic soups, easy to be prepared, and at the same time cheap. For barley- cream, it is not necessary to have at disposal a very succulent broth, which rather should be light, but white, that is, prepared with veal; either with a knuckle, or simply with some veal-trimmings. Melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, mix in six ounces of pearl- barley, of fine grains, let it fry for two or three minutes, moisten it then with four glassfuls of boiling water, add to it a pinch of salt. At the first bubbling, cover the stewpan, remove it back to the side of the fire; boil the barley for two hours, minding to add a little broth from time to time; when done, take it off the fire, bray it with a spoon in the same stewpan, pass it through a sieve ; lighten this puree with the broth requisite, and again strain it; let it boil, stirring it, and immediately remove it back to the side of the fire. Half an hour after, skim the fat off the soup, thicken it with a liaison of five yolks of eggs; season it with a little nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. Pour the soup into a tureen, passing it through a fine colander (see the drawing 77). 290. Crayfish-bisque. — For a bisque, that is to be served to seven or eight persons, mince two onions, one leek, one carrot, and a piece of celery root, or stick ; put them into a stewpan with butter, fry them gently for ten minutes; moisten them with two quarts of broth, either with or without meat; let the liquid boil, immediately remove it back to the side of the fire; add to it cloves and a bay-leaf. On the other hand, boil two dozen middling sized crayfish, with half a bottle of white wine, a bunch of parsley, and some vegetables ; drain them on a sieve, preserving their cooking-stock; take two thirds of these Draw. 77.118 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. crayfish, remove, and pluck their tails. Put into a mortar the shells of the tails as well as of the large claws, and the remainder of the crayfish, pound them with three handfuls of thin slices of bread, dried in the oven, and slightly browned ; remove the preparation from the mortar, turn it out into the boiling broth ; boil the soup for thirty-five minutes, pass it through a fine sieve, or a tammy; let it boil, mix in the cooking-stock of the crayfish, and a pinch of cayenne-pepper ; two minutes after, thicken it with a liaison of two yolks of eggs. Cut the crayfish-tails, put them into the tureen, into which now pour the soup. • 291. Crayfisli-soup, with rice. — Boil a score of crayfish, with wine, parsley, spices, and aromatics ; ten minutes after, drain them, remove all their meat; pound a third part of the meat with a part of the thin shell, and with the large claws ; when they are converted into paste, add to them a few spoonfuls of well boiled rice ; a few minutes after, dilute the pre- paration with the cooking-stock of the crayfish, and with some good fish- broth ; add to it two tablespoonfnls of tomata-puree ; pass the liquid through the sieve, pour it into a stewpan; add to it a pinch of pepper, and a piece of good butter, divided in little bits; make the soup hot, stirring it, but without allowing it to boil; pour it then into the tureen, add the preserved crayfish-tails cut in pieces. 292.

When the pieces of eel are done, drain them ; skim the fat off the soup, which pass through a sieve; thicken it with a liaison of four yolks of eggs. Trim the pieces119 FISH-SOUPS. of eels, place them in the tureen; add an onion previously minced in small rounds, then gently fried, and colored with butter in a skillet. Pour the soup into the tureen. 293. Perch soup, a la waterfish. — Boil five or six well cleansed perch, in white wine and fish-broth; drain them, let them cool, and remove their fillets ; divide these fillets, and keep them warm in a little stewpan. With three ounces of butter and the same of flour, prepare a little ‘roux’, without allowing it to take color ; dilute it with two quarts of the perch-stock, stir the liquid on the fire till it begins to boil, then remove it back to the side, mix up with it some vegetables and a bunch of parsley; thirty-five minutes after, skim off its fat, and strain the liquid ; then add to it a ‘julienne’ of roots previously blanched, composed of carrots, parsley-root, and celery-root; boil the soup for ten or twelve minutes, thicken it with a liaison of a few yolks of eggs, mix up with it the perch-fillets, and pour it into the tureen. 294. Lobster-soup. — Prepare some soup-stock (see art. 287) with fish-broth ; let it boil, on the side of the fire, for twenty minutes. — Divide in two parts the tail of a boiled lobster, cut the meat into small dice, which shut up in a stewpan, and keep by. — Remove the creamy parts from the body-shell, pound the upper shell, as well as the small claws, and the (cornet) shell, and mix them into the soup ; a few minutes after, pass this soup through a sieve; finish it with a little harvey-sauce, and a little cayenne-pepper ; add to it the lobster-meat in dice, pour it into the tureen. 295. Oyster-soup, with cream. — Oyster-soup is indeed a very excellent and distinguished soup, does not cost more than any other, and requires no long preparations. For this double reason it is highly to be recommended. — Open three or four dozen oysters ; if they are small, there must be a dozen more of them ; blanch them in a flat stewpan with half a bottle of white wine (art. 48). — With four ounces of butter, and >. the same of flour, prepare a light ‘roux’, without allowing it to take color; dilute it quite gently with the liquor of the oysters, and a quart of broth with or without meat. Stir the liquid until ebullition, remove it back toTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 120 tho side ot the lire, let it boil for forty minutes ; skim off its fat, season it highly, add to it a pinch of cayenne-pepper; thicken it with a liaison of five yolks of eggs. Pour the soup immediately into the tureen, passing it through a sieve; add the oysters, refreshed, drained, trimmed, and cut in two. 296. Sturgeon-soup, with curry.— Cut a piece "of fresh sturgeon, weighing one pound and a half; remove its skin, wash it, season it, let it braise with vegetables, wine, and broth. — On the other hand, mince two onions, one leek, and a piece of celery-root; let these vegetables fry with butter, moisten with three quarts of fish-broth, as well as with the cooking-stock of the sturgeon; stir the liquid until ebullition, then remove it back to the side of the fire ; add to it a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, thicken it with two spoonfuls of curry-powder, mixed with two spoonfuls of rice-meal, or potato-flour, diluted together with cold broth ; boil the soup for half an hour, then skim off its fat, pass it through a sieve, add to it the sturgeon-meat, divided in small squares, as well as five or six tablespoonfuls of boiled rice ; give it two bubblings, thicken it with a liaison of three yolks of eggs; pour it then into the tureen. 297. Turtle-soup, mock or genuine.— I will describe both these soups in such a manner as to render their preparation easy. Let me begin with the genuine turtle-soup. Take a good fat fowl, singed, and drawn; cut it up in four parts, which put into a stewpan with the paws, neck, and gizzard ; add a piece of raw ham, a knuckle of veal cut in pieces, some small onions, and a piece of butter. Fry these meats, and season them; when they are of a fine color, sprinkle over a tablespoonful of arrowroot or flour, which fry for two minutes; then moisten the meat with a glassful of dry white wine, and two or three quarts of broth; add a bunch garnished with aromatics, a piece of celery-root, and some peppercorns. Skim the liquid, at the first bubbling remove it back to the side of the fire. When the meat is done, drain it; skim the fat off the soup, pass it through a sieve into another stewpan, which place on the fire; at the first bubbling of the liquid, remove it, so that there be only a partial ebullition.121 FISH-SOUPS Open a box of good preserved turtle, place it in the ‘bain-marie’ to make the liquid dissolve ; pour it then on a sieve, and mix it in the soup, as well as a glassful of madeira, and a small handful of odoriferousTIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 122 herbs; such as : leaves of marjoram, of thyme, of basil, of savory, and parsley. Cover the stewpan. Cut the turtle’s meat into small pieces of equal size, place them in a small stewpan, moisten them with a little of the soup, keep them warm. Ten minutes after, skim the fat off the soup, add to the latter half a glassful of madeira, and a pinch of cayenne - pepper; give it but one bubbling, pour it into the tureen, passing it through a sieve; add the pieces of turtle, add also the juice of a lemon. — To this soup may be always added small veal or poultry quenelles, as well as minced trulfles. In these conditions of course the soup is more luxurious. Here is the method of preparing mock-turtle : cut off half a calf’s head of middling size, blanch, and singe it; divide it in pieces, boil it in plain white stock. When at the degree requisite, let it nearly cool, in its cooking-stock, then drain it; now remove from each piece of the call s head the interior parts, commonly being very fat; divide the cutaneous parts in long squares, which place in a stewpan, pour on a little madeira, and keep them warm. On the other hand, with a good fowl, a little ham, vegetables, and aromatics, prepare a stock such as described above, mix into it a part ot the cooking-stock of the calf’s head. When well skimmed, tree from fat, and passed through a sieve, add to it the pieces of calf’s head, and the madeira. Infuse the aromatics separately in a small stewpan. At serv- ing-time, mix in the soup a pinch of cayenne-pepper. 298. Mackerel - soup. — Choose two or three small very fresh mackerel; cleanse them, remove their heads, divide the fish in pieces, and place them in a stewpan with butter; salt them, let them fry till they have taken a good color; then add some minced vegetables, and a bunch of parsley ; moisten them with a quart of boiling water, boil them on a very slow fire for three quarters of an hour. Skim the fat off the liquid, then pass the fish, as well as the vegetables, through a sieve; dilute the puree with the liquid, add to it a quart of fish-broth ; stir the soup on the fire till ebullition, mix into it a piece of butter, a pinch of cayenne- pepper, and some tablespoonfuls of rice, simply boiled in water ; pour it into the tureen.HOT HORS-D’OEUVRE. Hot ‘hors-d’oeuvre’ are dishes, which are usually served, either after the soup, or after the fish; but which are never set on the table, but always presented directly to the guests. These dishes are either fried, or cooked in the oven ; for this reason, they are also generally dished on .a folded napkin. 299. Plover’s-eggs in a napkin. Choose a fipe damask napkin, fold it on the wrong side, roll it up in a ring, and fasten it with two pins ; place it on a dish, and fill the central Draw.

Sandwiches of various sorts. Sandwiches are of English origin, but now-a-days are known nearly every where. — Sandwiches are prepared with slices of stale household- bread, cut in the shape of long squares ; these slices are masked with a layer of plain butter, or with butter mixed with mustard or anchovy- extract : this being a matter of taste ; this layer is masked with a slice of either boiled pickled-tongue or of ham, poultry or veal, cut of the same dimensions as the bread ; sometimes the tongue or ham is mingled with veal or poultry ; in either case, the meat is covered again with another slice of buttered bread, cut in the same dimensions as the first. The sandwiches are then cut into regular form on the sides and extremities. 301. Crusts with Cheshire-cheese. Cut some slices of household-bread not too thin; fry them with butter on one side only, and in a flat stewpan, or in a baking-sheet; drain them, and mask their fried side with a thick layer of grated Cheshire- cheese ; season the cheese with a pinch of simple pepper or cayenne- pepper. Put the crusts back into the baking-sheet with butter, push them into a hot oven. When the cheese is creamy, the top of the crusts must be dry ; now disengage them, and serve. 302. Snipe crusts. From off a household loaf, cut seven or eight slices of bread of the shape of a long square, and the thickness of a third of an inch; allow them to take a little color on one side in a saute-pan, imme- diately drain them. — Put the raw intestines of two snipes into a stewpan, with two tablespoonfuls of bacon cut in small dice, a piece of butter, some aromatics, and five or six good poultry-livers, or some thin slices of calf’s liver; let them fry on a good fire, turning them till the livers be well done; let them cool, pound them, pass them through a sieve. Introduce into the puree two tablespoonfuls of good brown-sauce125 HOT -HORS-D'OEUVRE’: - CANAPES, CRUSTS. reduced with a little glaze, and madeira; add to it four yolks of eggs, and a pinch of nutmeg. With this preparation mask the slices of bread with a thick layer, applying it to their fried side; let the preparation bulk out, carefully smoothe it, and put the crusts back into the stewpan holding the butter; which warm, and push the stewpan into a slack oven, in order to let the bread fry, at the same time, as the preparation gets poached. These crusts yield an excellent luncheon. 303. ‘Canapes’ of various sorts. ‘Canapes’ are something of the species of sandwiches, but of another nature. — Cut some slices of household-bread in the shape ot a long square ; broil them very slightly on both sides; when they have cooled, mask one ot their sides with a layer of butter mixed with an- chovy-extract; upon this layer arrange symmetrically either some tine anchovy-fillets, herring-fillets, fillets ot pickled thunny, or else some smoked salmon, or crayfish - tail s ; intermingle these various fillets with chopped hard-boiled eggs, gerkins, or parsley, like- wise chopped, then with whole capers, and lastly with caviar. Dish these ‘canapes’ on a folded napkin. 304. Hot canapes with ham. Cut some slices of oblong shape off a loaf of household-bread, three lines thick, place them in a saute-pan with butter, in order to give them a nice color on one side; turn them immediately, then set on each of these slices another slice of raw ham, cut of the same size as the bread; sprinkle a little pepper over the ham, push the saute-pan into a hot oven, in order to color the other side of the bread, as well as to heat the ham. 305. Crusts with oysters. Cut some slices off a loaf of household-bread, giving the slices a square shape, and the thickness of a third of an inch. Cern them all Draw. 80.126 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. round, on one surface only, and with the aid of the point of a little knife; fry them on both sides with butter; when they are drained, open and empty them. — On the other hand, blanch a few dozen oysters, trim them, divide them in middling-sized dice. Let reduce a little white-sauce of good consistence, finished with a little anchovy-butter, or anchovy- extract, and a pinch of cayenne-pepper. When the sauce is at the degree requisite, mix in it the oysters, which remove immediately: the prepara- tion must remain consistent. With this preparation, fill the hollow of the crusts, sprinkle over a little grated parmesan, baste it with a little melted butter; glaze it with the red-hot shovel, and serve these crusts. 306. Patties of veal-sweetbreads, with gravy. Cut into large dice, two or three veal-sweetbreads, or lamb-sweet- breads ; put them into a stewpan with half their volume of raw ham, equally cut in dice; add some butter, fry them on a slow fire, turning them; four or five minutes after, add two or three cut truffles. Season them, pour over four tablespoonfuls of white wine; let the liquid reduce on a brisk fire, take the stewpan off the fire. With some short-paste line ten tartlet-moulds, of high shape and channeled; mask the paste with a layer of quenelle force-meat [see art. 116); fill then the hollow with the sweetbread ‘salpicon’; cover this ‘salpicon with a layer of the same force-meat, then with a round flat of short-paste ; make a little aperture in the centre of each cover; egg the paste on the top, bake the patties in a slack oven ; when taken out of the oven, turn them out, then by the central aperture infilter into each of the patties some spoonfuls of brown-sauce; cover the aperture with a little cover of puff-paste, baked separately. Dish the patties in a pyramid. 307. Small oyster-patties. With fine short-paste spread eight or ten channeled tartlet-moulds. Fill them with raw fish quenelle force-meat, range the moulds on a baking- sheet, push them into a slack oven; when the paste is well done, take it out. Then cut the force-meat to a level with the paste, and slightly hol- low the little patties.127 HOT ‘HORS-D’OEUVRE’: — PATTIES. Cut a large ‘salpicon’ of cooked oysters, add to it a quarter its volume of cooked mushrooms, also cut; thicken them with a little good white sauce, reduced with the fresh trimmings of the mushrooms, and a small part of the oyster-liquor. With this ‘salpicon’ fill the hollow of the little patties, immediately mask it with a layer of well reduced bechamel- sauce, mixed up with a whipped white #f egg. Smoothe the sauce, push Draw. 82. the little patties into the oven ; twelve minutes after, take them out, remove them from the moulds, dish them on a folded napkin. 308. Puff-paste patties with veal force-meat.

Puff-paste patties, with fish-force-meat. Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of fish-quenelle force-meat (see art. 122) rather firm ; introduce into it two teaspoonfuls of anchovy- extract, and a pinch of chopped parsley. With this force-meat, garnish fifteen small flats of puff-paste, and finish the patties, proceeding as said in art. 308 ; egg, and bake them in a warm oven for twenty minutes. When they are taken out of the oven, disengage them from the baking- sheet, and range them in a pyramid, on a dish, or a folded napkin. 310. Small thrush-patties. Bone ten small thrushes, season them interiorly, mask them with a thin layer of good force-meat (see art. 120) ; place on the centre of each of the thrushes a piece of raw truffle, then roll them to a round shape, surround them with a buttered strip of paper; range them side by side in a saute-pan, bake them in the oven with a little white wine and stock, but short of moisture; let them nearly cool in their cooking-stock ; then unwrap them, trim them, glaze them with the pastebrush, and warm them at the entrance of the oven. With some game quenelle force-meat fill ten patty-moulds, lined with paste ; range them on a baking-sheet, cover them with a buttered round of paper, bake them in a slack oven for twenty-five minutes ; when they are taken out of the oven, slightly hollow them out; then set upon each of them a thrush ‘galantine’, which mask with a little reduced good sauce, and dish up. 311. Patties and fried brains. Patties are prepared with a poultry force-meat, into which is mixed a ‘salpicon’ of raw truffles. Patties must be baked a short while previous to being served: as far as possible, they ought not to cool, when once baked.HOT ‘HORS-D'OEUVRE’. 129 The brains must be boiled in acidulous water; then they are left to cool, and after being trimmed to a round shape, they are placed in a kitchen-basin, seasoned, then basted with the juice of a lemon sprinkled with chopped parsley; then they are drained, dipped into a frying-paste, and plunged into hot fat. When the paste is dry, and of a nice color, Draw. 87. drain the fritters, dish them in a pyramid-shape, on the centre of the circle formed by the patties, on a folded napkin. 312. Small poultry-patties, ‘a Pancienne’.

Cover the preparation with a round flat of paste, soldeiing it to the edges; make an aperture on the top. Fgg the paste, bake the patties in a slack oven ; when they are taken from the oven, turn them out; then by the aperture on the top, introduce into the interior a little good brown-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of the truffles. Close the aperture with a little round of cooked puff-paste ; dish the patties on a folded napkin. 9THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 130 313. Small patties, ‘a la financiere’. With fine short-paste, line a dozen channeled tartlet-moulds rather high in shape. Mask the paste inwardly with paper, then till the hollow with common flour; thus bake the little patties in a slack oven; when they are taken out, remove the paper and flour, mask then the inside with a thin layer of force-meat, and keep them at the entrance of the oven. On the other hand, cut out of a puff-paste flat a dozen rounds, with the aid of a paste-cutter adapted to the diameter of the tartlet-moulds ; egg them, draw lines on their top with the point of a small knife, bake them in the oven to a nice color. Prepare a garnish composed of cocks’-combs, little scollops of fat- liver and truffles, and some small 1 quenelles’; pour on this garnish a little brown-sauce, reduced and succulent, then heat it without ebulli- tion. Draw 90. At serving-time, fill the little patties with the garnish previously prepared, cover them with the rounds of puff-paste, dish them on a folded napkin. 314. Chicken-patties, with mushrooms. Line some tartlet-moulds with short-paste ; fill the interior with raw poultry force-meat, mixed with cooked mushrooms, cut in small dice; cover the force-meat with a flat of paste, setting it fast on that of the edges ; make a small hole on the centre in order to facilitate the evapo- ration. Bake the patties in the oven for 35 minutes ; when taken out, remove the moulds, then pour into the interior, by the opening a top, a little good gravy or sauce : serve them quite hot. — Patties of game, and also of fish, may be prepared in the same way- 315. Small patties, ‘a la dauphine’. Roll out a pound and a half of brioche-paste to flats three or four lines thick ; with a round tin-cutter, of five centimeters in diameter, cut out of the surface of this paste forty little round flats, range half of them on a baking-sheet, in order to garnish their centre with a small ball of ‘croquette’ preparation ; moisten the edges ot these flats, then cover them131 HOT ‘HORS-D’OEUVRE’ one by one with the flats previously put by; press on the upper flat with the thumb, cut them again with the same tin-cutter, and this done, place them one by one on a floured cloth, spread on a baking-sheet, but mind ranging them at a little distance one from the other.

Chicken ‘rissoles’. Prepare a ‘salpicon’ composed of cooked chicken-meat, mushrooms, Draw. 92. Draw. 93. and pickled tongue; thicken it with a little ‘bechamel- sauce reduced with a some glaze ; the sauce must be consistent, and not too abundante. Pour the preparation into a small basin, let it cool. On the other hand, roll out twelve ounces of puff-paste at seven turns, or of good trimmings of puff-paste, or even simply of fine short- paste; spread the paste in along, and square, but thin strip; take up 9*132 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. with a teaspoon little bits of the preparation previously got ready, and range them transversally on this strip about an inch from its edges; moisten the paste all round the preparation, then fold the paste over in such a manner as to cover this preparation ; cut then the ‘rissoles’ with a channeled paste-cutter (see drawing 92); this done, cut the paste straight, and begin the same operation again. Dip the ‘rissoles’ into beaten eggs, fry them on a slow lire, clish them in a nice group on a folded napkin. 317. Ox-palate rissoles. Put into a stewpan a ‘salpicon’ of ox-palate-fillets, mix it up with a quarter its volume of cooked mushrooms cut the same way ; thicken this salpicon’ with reduced ‘bechamel’-sauce, finished with a little glaze; let it cool, then divide it into little pieces, which roll up to a round shape, and with them form the ‘rissoles’, proceeding as told, art. 316. When it is time to serve, let the ‘rissoles’ fry, drain, and dish them. 318. Marrow ‘rissoles’. Let soak whole a large piece of beef-marrow; boil it in broth, let it cool in its own liquor, then divide it into little bits the size of an olive; •let them cool well, to dip them twice into some good, well reduced brown- sauce, finished with glaze, in order to be able to coat them nicely; range these pieces one by one on a baking-sheet, let the sauce cool. Now form the ‘rissoles’, proceeding as said above, garnishing each of them with a piece of this sauced marrow ; cut them with a tin-cutter, breadcrumb them, equalise, and let them fry on a slow fire; drain, and dish them,.in a group, on a folded napkin. 319. Pike ‘rissoles’. Prepare some quenelle force-meat, in the same conditions as for anchovy-patties. — Take some fine short-paste, prepared with ten ounces of butter, and a pound of flour. Let this paste set, then roll it out, cut it with a channeled tin-cutter of two inches’ diameter; on the centre of each of these flats set a little ball of force-meat; moisten the paste with the aid of a paste-brush, then fold the flat in such a manner, that the force-meat133 IIOT TIORS-D’OEUVKE’. be enclosed ; fasten the edges of the ‘rissole’, dip them, one by one, into beaten eggs, breadcrumb them, fry them at a slow fire. 320. Oyster -‘rissoles’. Blanch a few dozen oysters {see art. 48); preserve their liquor, refresh them, and cut them into small dice; season this ‘salpicon’ with a pinch of pepper, thicken them with a few spoonfuls of good bechamel-sauce, reduced at the moment with a little glaze; pour the preparation into a little basin, let them cool. — Take the trimmings of puff-paste, or else of some fine short-paste, which roll out to a thin flat of square shape. With a channeled tin-cutter, of two inches’ diameter, cut out of this flat some rounds; on the centre of each of these rounds place a little ball of the preparation previously got ready; moisten the paste, then fold over one side of the flat, so as to form a kind of crescent, such as represented by the drawing 95. Thin the rim of the ‘rissoles’ with the aid of the fingers, dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them; plunge them into hot frying-fat, fry them quite gently; when the paste is done, drain, and dish them. 321. Rissoles, ‘a la Perigueux’. Cut up some raw truffles in small dice, put them into a stewpan, add to them a few spoonfuls of madeira-wine, which reduce to glaze; season and finish them, thickening them with a little brown-sauce, and glaze, reduced together; let this ‘salpicon’ cool, divide it in little pieces which roll up into balls, and with them now form the ‘rissoles’, proceeding as told at the art. 220. At serving-time, let them fry, and dish them. 322. Pompadour ‘rissoles’. Bake a dozen large pancakes prepared without sugar; divide them in round flats with a tin-cutter {coupe-pate), of two inches, and a half in diameter; garnish the centre of these flats with a ‘salpicon’ with fat-liver and truffles; then spread all round this ‘salpicon’ a slight layer of raw134 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. quenelle lorce-meat; now fold the round up, so as entirely to wrap up the preparation forming the ‘rissoles’; slightly press on the edges, bread- crumb them, and fry them to a nice color; drain, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 323. Crayfish-‘croquettes’, ‘a la comtesse’. Prepare a crayfish-‘salpicon’, which keep covered. — Reduce a little ‘bechamel’-sauce, introducing into it a little cream, and a few table- spoonfuls of mushroom-liquor. When it is of nice consistence, finish it with a piece of crayfish - butter, two tablespoonfuls of cooked mush- room, cut in dice ; remove it off the fire; add to this sauce the ‘salpicon’, introducing it carefully ; pour the preparation into a kitchen-basin, and let it cool. Form the ‘croquettes’ in the shape of a cork, round, or flat; breadcrumb, and fry them ; drain, and dish them in a group, on a folded napkin. 324. Lamb-‘croquettes’, with artichokes. Take a piece of cooked and cooled lamb, remove its sinewy skin; cut the meat into small dice, add to it half its volume of artichoke-bot- toms, cut like the meat. Pour some spoonfuls of good ‘bechamel’-sauce into a stewpan, let it reduce, mind stirring it, in order to introduce into it, first some spoonfuls of good cream, and then some spoonfuls of melted glaze; when it is succulent, nicely firm, take it off the fire, and mix in it the ‘salpicon’ previously prepared ; season with a little pepper and nutmeg; spread it on a baking-sheet, in a layer a third of an inch thick, let it cool well; then form the ‘croquettes’, breadcrumb them, and fry them according to the general rules. 325. Rissoles, and ‘croquettes’. If the ‘rissoles’ are prepared with a poultry-‘salpicon’, the ‘croquettes’ may be prepared with some game or fat-liver ‘salpicon’. — If the ‘ris- soles’ are prepared with an oyster-‘salpicon’, the ‘croquettes’ may be prepared with a ‘salpicon’ of crayfish tails or lobster. The essential thing is that the ‘rissoles’ and ‘croquettes’ be not pre- pared precisely with the same species of meat or fish ; yet both the pre-135 HOT ‘HORS-D'OEUVRE’. parations must be of the same nature, that is, both prepared with meat, or else both prepared with fish. The ‘rissoles’ must be of a tine shape, and fried without being bread- crumbed ; they are dished in a circular order on a folded napkin. — The ‘croquettes’ must be formed into little balls, breadcrumbed and fried, Draw. 96. then dished up, in a pyramid, in the centre of the circular hollow formed by the ‘rissoles’. 226.

A few moments previous to serving, plunge these 'croquettes’ into plenty of hot fat, but be careful to take a few at a time; immediately when they have got of a fine color, drain them on a cloth, and dish them in a group formed by two rows, on a folded napkin. 327. Turkey-‘croquettes’. Irim, and cut in small dice, some parts of the breast of a cooked turkey; put them into a stewpan, with the same quantity of rice boiled in biotli, but diy and of whole grain ; sprinkle over the preparation a table- spoonful of curry-powder, and keep it covered. I our into a flat stewpan two glassfuls of 'bechamel’-sauce, reduce it on the fire, stirring, and introducing into it, by degrees, some spoonfuls of melted glaze; when the sauce is of a nice consistence, finish it with a tablespoonful of curry-powder, diluted with a little good cream; then add to it the meat and rice ; take the stewpan off the fire, pour the pre- paration into a kitchen-basin, in order to let it cool; when it has got firm, take it up in equal parts with a spoon, let these parts drop on the table sprinkled with bread-crumb; roll them to the shape of cork-screws, dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them, plunge them into hot frying-fat; as soon as they have taken a nice color, drain them, and dish them. 328. Macaroni-‘croquettes’. Boil half a pound of macaroni in salted water, drain it, put it into a stewpan, finish it by introducing five ounces of butter, .three ounces of grated parmesan, as well as a few spoonfuls of truffles, and pickled- tongue, cut up in small dice; pour the preparation into a buttered saute- pan, spreading it in a layer an inch thick ; cover it with paper, let it cool with a weight on, in order to divide it in rounds with a plain tin-cutterHOT ‘HORS-D’OEUVRE’. 137 of can inch in diameter; now roll the 'croquettes’ in grated parmesan, dip them into beaten eggs, breadcrumb them, fry them to a fine color, drain and dish them in a group, on a folded napkin. 329.

Turbot-‘croquettes’. Take a thick piece ot cooked turbot, from which remove bones as well as skin, and then distribute the meat into little dice, place this salpicon in a little stewpan, add to it half its volume of cooked mush- rooms, equally cut in dice; keep it covered. Pour a few spoonfuls of good ‘bechamel’-sauce (see art. 141) into a stewpan, which set on a brisk fire; work the sauce with a spoon, without leaving it; from time to time add to it a little good raw cream: when reduced to halt its volume, when firm, creamy, and of a nice consistence, add to it the turbot- and mushroom-‘salpicon’: when the preparation is at the degree requisite, the ‘salpicon’ must absorb the sauce entirely, so as to form a consistent preparation; this done, immediately remove the stewpan off the fire, season the preparation to high relish, pour it on a dish, and thus let it cool. Roll the croquettes into the shape of a cork, breadcrumb, and fry them. ■ ^ 337. Fried chicken-‘quenelles’. Take filteen poached and cooled ‘quenelles’ (see chicken-quenelles with truffles); dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them; at serving-time, plunge them into hot frying-fat, let them take a nice color, drain them, dish them up, on a napkin, with fried parsley. 338. ‘Bouchees’ (patties) and ‘croquettes’. The mixed ‘hors-d’oeuvre’ have the double advantage, of offering to the guests a various choice of food, and to contrast the other dishes, which generally do not admit of any mixture. The ‘bouchees’ can be garnished with game or poultry ‘salpicon’, but they may also be garnished with a ‘salpicon’ of crayfish, prawns, oysters, or lobster.HUT TICKS-D’OEUVRE’. 141 The'croquettes’ garnishing the centre of the dish, are pear-shaped, the stalk of these pears being imitated by a stem of parsley, or else by a fillet of truffle or pickled tongue. But mind, these stalks must be only added to the 'croquettes’, after they are fried. Draw. 104. ‘Croquettes’, as well as the patties, with which they are served, can be prepared with poultry, game, or fish, according as the patties are garnished. 339.

Fill the patties then with a of an inch and a third in diameter; roll these ‘croustades’ then in fresh bread-crumb, dip them into beaten eggs, and again bread-crumb them: corn them superficially, on one side only, with a tin-cutter of one inch diameter, in order to mark the lid. Plunge them then into plenty of hot frying-fat, let them fry, drain them ; remove their lid, empty them, and fill them with a ‘salpicon’ composed of crayfish - tails and mushrooms, thickened with a little good white-sauce; which then cover with the lid. 340. Stuffed poultry-‘quenelles’. Line two dozen tartlet-moulds, either oblong or cutlet-shaped, with poultry ‘quenelles’ force-meat; garnish the inside of each of the ‘quenelles’ with a small portion part of truffle ‘montglas’ (see art. 40), cooled, and rolled up into an olive-shape ; mask the ‘montglas’ with a layer of force- meat, then range the moulds in a saute-pan; let the force-meat poach in the oven with a little hot water on the bottom of the saute-pan, and a sheet of paper as a cover. As soon as the force-meat has become firm, remove the ‘quenelles’ out of the moulds, to let them cool; breadcrumb them twice, let them fry, drain, and dish them in a group, on a folded napkin. 341. Small ‘timbales’, Scottish fashion. Butter eighteen‘dariole’-moulds, breadcrumb them, mask them in- side with strips of pancakes prepared without sugar. Get ready a preparation, composed half with cooked poultry-puree, half with raw force-meat, mixed with a ‘salpicon’ of cooked mushrooms. With this preparation fill the hollow of the moulds, cover it with a little flat of pancake ; range these small ‘timbales’ on a baking-sheet, and bake them in a slack oven ; as soon as they are done, turn them out, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 342. Small macaroni-‘timbales’. Butter ten or twelve ‘dariole’-moulds. Boil twelve ounces of small macaroni in salt water, but without breaking them ; drain them without refreshing, and then spread them on a napkin.HOT ‘HORS-D’OEUVRE’. Draw. 108. 143 Take the macaroni up one by one, range them spirally at the bot- tom, and all round the sides of each of the buttered moulds, beginning with the bottom.

With the aid of a wet tea-spoon, smoothe the inside of the force-meat,* then fill the hollow with a cold ‘salpicon’ composed of pickled- Draw. 107. tongue, truffles, and mushrooms : this ‘salpicon’ must be thickened with a succulent, and well reduced brown-sauce. Mask the ‘salpicon’ with a layer of force-meat, which again mask with a round of buttered paper. Range the ‘timbales’ in a saute-pan with hot water, let them poach at the entrance of the oven for twenty-five minutes; when taken out, drain their moisture, turn them out, put them on a hot dish, the bottom of which then mask with a little good sauce. 343. Rice-‘croustades’, with partridge-puree. Blanch a pound and a quarter of rice ; drain it, put it into a stew- pan, moisten it to three times its height with broth, the fat of which has not been skimmed; cover it, let it boil on a good fire, till the broth be nearly absorbed ; then remove the rice back on a very slow fire, introduce into it a piece of butter, a handful of grated parmesan, and a pinch of nutmeg ; pour it into a but- tered saute-pan, in a manner giving the layer of rice the thickness of two inches ; press it close, then smoothe its surface, let it cool for two or three hours. Take a round paste-cutter of an inch diameter, dip it into warm144 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. water, and with it cut, out of the thickness of the rice, twelve small ‘croustades’; remove them from the stewpan, roll them out in fresh bread-crumb, dip them into well beaten eggs, breadcrumb them again, set them in an upright position, cern them on the top, with a plain paste- cutter of nearly an inch ; (that means, that the preparation must be cut lightly, so as to mark the aperture of the ‘croustades’;) plunge these ‘croustades’ into hot frying-fat, let them take a nice color, drain them; now with the aid of a small knife remove the cover, empty them, leaving but the thickness of a third of an inch on the bottom and sides ; fill them immediately with partridge - puree (see art. 83); pour over the puree a little melted glaze, set a slice of cooked truffle, which is to replace the cover, on each of the ‘croustades’. 344. Small ‘timbales’ of crayfish, and sole-fillets. Small ‘timbales’ may be prepared either with rice, ‘nouilles’, or fish force-meat, according to one of the methods described above ; but it is preferable to have them breadcrumbed, then emptied, and filled with a ‘salpicon’ of crayfish, or lobster, or else with an oyster-‘sa’picon. The sole-fillets are cut in ‘eguillettes’, that is, into thin strips; then they are seasoned, floured, and plunged into hot flit; when they are drained, they must be sprinkled with a little salt, then dished in a group, in the centre of the hollow formed by the ‘timbales’, on a folded napkin. 345. Small ‘nouilles’-timbales, Genoese way. Butter eighteen ‘dariole’-moulds, breadcrumb them, line them with tine short-paste, then fill the hollow with ‘nouilles’ finished with butter and grated parmesan, seasoned, and slightly thickened with a little sauce. Cover the ‘timbales’ with a round of paste, bake them in a hot oven, then turn them out, and dish them. 34(i. Little force-meat ‘timbales’, with truffles. Prepare a poultry-, game-, or fish-‘quenelle’ force-meat; add to it a few tablespoonfuls of truffles cut in small dice.

In order to prepare ‘cannelons’, one must have little wooden columns very slightly pointed, three inches long, of half an inch diameter on the thick end. There may also be employed leaden tubes in the manner of the tubes of the column-box. — Roll out thin twelve ounces of puff-paste, giving the flat a long shape ; out of this paste cut some strips half an-inch by six: mind, cutting them pointed on one end. Take ten of the tubes or columns, butter them, then surround them in a spiral Draw.no. way with a strip of paste, beginning with the smallest end, that is to say, forming with the paste circles ‘a cheval’, one upon the other: the paste must be but little floured, so that the circles may stick together. End the spiral at an inch from the thick end of the column, slightly moisten- ing the paste. Range the ‘cannelons’ on a baking-sheet, placing them at little distances from one another; egg them, bake them in a slack oven, so that the paste can bake well, without taking too much color. 10146 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Five minutes after the ‘cannelons’ have been taken out of the oven, till their hollow with a ‘salpicon’ of game, poultry, or even sweetbread, mixed with truffles, mushrooms, or pickled tongue, according to the nature of the meat, that has been employed. — The ‘cannelons’ are filled, by the aid of a little silk-bag, or a cornet of strong paper. 348. Fat-liver ‘timbales’. Prepare a pound and a quarter of poultry force-meat; place it in a kitchen-basin, add to it four tablespoonfuls of puree of cooked poultry- livers. With this force-meat fill fourteen large dariole-moulds, which place in a saute-pan ; let the force-meat poach in the ‘bain-marie’, that is, without ebullition. As soon as the force-meat has got firm, turn the ‘tim- bales’ out, let them cool, then dip them into beaten eggs, breadcrumb them, then scoop them on the top with a small paste-cutter, in order to manage subsequently an aperture on that side. A few minutes previous to serving, plunge these ‘timbales’ into hot fat, so as to impart to them a fine color; drain them, open, draw them, leaving but a little thickness, on the sides, and at the bottom ; then fill them with a ‘salpicon’ of fat-liver, mixed with truffles, and thickened with a little good brown-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of raw truffles. Cover the ‘timbales’, dish them up in a pyramid, on a folded napkin. 349. Lamb-sweetbread, ‘a la Villeroi’. Blanch fifteen fine lamb-sweetbreads, let them cool with a light weight on, then split each of them in two broadwise, fry these scollops in butter, trim them to an equal shape ; when they have cooled, mask them with ‘Villeroi’- sauce, then breadcrumb them twice; now fry them to a nice color, drain, and dish them in a group, on a napkin ; set a bunch of fried parsley on the top. 350. Larks in their nest. Bone ten larks, season them, fill them with a ‘gratin’ force-meat, mixed with a few spoonfuls of poultry-livers, and a few raw truffles cut in dice; fold the ‘galantines’, giving them a round shape; surroundDraw. 111.

Singe the heads of the larks, glaze them with the paste-brush, keep them also hot. Choose ten cooked artichoke-bottoms of an equal size; drain them, range them on a small baking-sheet, the hollow side upper- most ; into the hollow of each of the artichokes place a lark, the head of which has previously been fixed on, mask it with a little sauce, surround it with a circle of little balls in poached force-meat, in imitation of little eggs; keep the baking-sheet at the entiance of the oven, for a few minutes, then dish the larks. 351. Fried poultry-cutlets. These cutlets are prepared with a ‘salpicon’, composed of cooked poultry-meat, mixed ivell with truffles, pickled tongue, or cooked mush- looms. This ‘salpicoiT may be prepared in the same conditions as a cioquette-preparation, then it is divided into small parts, to which is gi\ en the shape of a cutlet. These cutlets are dipped into beaten eggs, breadcrumbed, and plunged into hot fat. But these cutlets may also be prepared with a cooled 'salpicon’, cut to the shape of cutlets, then masked with a thin layer of force-meat, breadcrumbed with egg, and fried ; the latter method being preferable. io*148 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKEHY-BOOIv. Instead of masking the ‘salpicon’ with a layer of force-meat, these cutlets may simply be prepared, by mixing into the force-meat by turns the poultry, the truffles, the pickled tongue, and the mushrooms cut in dice in this case, the total of the ‘salpicon’ must be of an equal quantity with the force-meat, but care must be taken to add to the ‘salpicon’ a few spoonfuls of melted glaze, or of good cooled sauce. When the cutlets are fried and drained, to each of them is fitted (on the pointed end) either a piece of parsley-stem, or else a fillet of truffle, in imitation of the bone. The cutlets are then dished in a circle, on a folded napkin; the hollow of the circle is garnished with fried parsley. 352. Truffle -‘cromesquis’. Boil in the stock-pot one or two calf-udders (t Stine), let them cool, trim them, divide them into thin slices off their largest side; slightly beat these slices, so as to diminish their thickness. Prepare a croquette-preparation composed of white meat of poultry, fat-livers, and cooked truffles, cut up to dice ; thicken it with some reduced white-sauce, let it cool on ice, spreading it in a layer the third part of an inch thick ; divide it then into equal portions, of a half-flat shape. Now mask each part of the preparation with one or more slices of udder, so as completely to wrap them up. At serving-time, dip the ‘cromesquis’, one by one, into frying-paste, immediately plunge them into hot fat, so as to impart to them a nice color; drain them, dish them up in a pyramid on a folded napkin, set a bunch of fried parsley on their top. 353. Lamb-cutlets, ‘en papillotes’. Take eighteen half-sheets of paper, of a white but rather thick soit; fold them up, and cut them to half the figure of a heart, so that the piece cut out, when opened, shows nearly the shape of a heart; slightly oil the paper, and put it by. Trim nicely eighteen lamb-cutlets, seasfti them, range them m a saute-pan, with melted bacon ; let them fry, turning them ; when the) aieHOT “HORS - D’OEUVRE’. 140 nearly done, sprinkle over a few tablespoonfuls of cooked tine-herbs, and so finish cooking them ; then pour on a little melted glaze, let them cool in the saute-pan. Now take the cutlets one by one, mask both their sides with a thin layer of the fine-herbs preparation ; immediately set them one by one on the oiled paper-hearts, turning the bone to the pointed end of the heart, fold the paper, in order carefully to plait it all round, so that the cutlet be well wrapt-up; range Draw. 113.

Oil eight or ten folded paper-cases (see drawing 115) not too small; and keep them in the hot-closet. Take the meat of a cooked and cooled chicken, or simply the remainders of some roast poultry (half a pound) ; pound the meat, until it be converted into paste ; then mix up with it a gill of good ‘bechamel’- sauce, reduced with cream, and finished with a little meat-glaze ; the mixture being- operated, pass the preparation through a coarse sieve, then through a finer one, or through a tammy.

Small cases of soft-roes, with crayfish-‘coulis’. Soak and blanch some fine soft-roes of carp or mackerel, drain them on a cloth, in order to spunge them. Fry in a saute-pan a few spoonfuls of fine-herbs, thicken them with a little glaze, add to them the soft-roes, which roll up in this seasoning, and with them, fill a dozen oiled small cases lined with a light layer of force-meat; immediately range these cases on a baking-sheet, keep them at the entrance of the oven for a few minutes. At serving-time, mask them with a little reduced white-sauce, finish it with apiece of cray- fish-butter ; dish the small cases on a folded napkin. 356. Small cases of oysters. Blanch five or six dozen oysters with a little white wine, drain them, beard, and place them in a saute-pan; thicken them with a little reduced yellow - sauce, finished with crayfish - butter; with this garnish fill the paper-cases, previously oiled; mask the top with a thin layer of bread- crumb, fried in butter ; immediately dish the cases on a folded napkin. 357. Shells of lamb-sweetbreads. ' Cut in dice fifteen lamb-sweetbreads, not too much boiled, but cold; mix them with a third their volume of cooked mushrooms ; keep the ‘sal- picon covered. Pour into a stewpan some spoonfuls of good ‘bechamel’- sauce, let it reduce, gradually introducing into it the cooking-stock of the lamb-sweetbreads, so as to get a half brown-sauce; as soon as it is very firm, and succulent, mix the ‘salpicon’ up with it; immediately take the preparation off the fire, and with it, fill large table - shells; smoothe the preparation on the top, sprinkle over a little bread-crumb, pour over a little melted butter, let it slightly gratinate in a quick oven, or else with a red-hot shovel, and serve them. 358.

Skewers of turkey-giblets. Take the liver, heart, and crop, of two or three turkeys; remove the gall from the livers, which distribute in large squares, and put into a kitchen-basin; add to these squares, the hearts, each of which has been divided in two ; open the crops, empty them, wash them in warm water, file them up on an end of thread, and let them boil for three quarters of an hour in the stock-pot; drain them, and divide them, removing the hard skin ; now cut them to the same diameter as the livers, and mix them up with the latter; season the meat with salt, pepper, and chopped pars- ley ; moisten them with a little oil, mix them with the same quantity of thin squares of bacon, as of liver and crop-squares ; then file up the meat on little skewers, alternating them ; roll them in bread-crumb, range them on a gridiron, and let them boil for ten or twelve minutes, turning them; serve them on a warm dish. 361. Truffled pig’s feet. Carefully pluck twelve ounces of raw truffles, peel them in order to cut them into dice, put them into a saute-pan with a few spoonfuls of madeira; reduce the liquid on a brisk fire, the truffles must be tossed; then thicken them with a spoonful of brown-sauce, and a little melted glaze ; let them cool. On the other hand, boil four pig’s-feet; when they are drained, divide each of them in two ; remove the bone, fill the hollow left with a small portion of the truffle-preparation; smoothe it well with the blade of a knife, then mask it with a layer of raw force-meat, entirely wrapping it in. Now breadcrumb the pig’s feet; give them a little color on the gridiron, or else in a hot oven, basting them with melted butter; when done, serve them in a group, on a hot dish.HOT ‘HORS-D’OEUVRE’. 362.

Lambs’ feet, ‘a la Villeroi’. Singe two dozen lambs’ feet, blanch them, boil them in the stock- broth ; let them half-cool in their cooking-stock, then bone them entirely, but without opening them ; fill the hollow, left by the bones, with cooked fine-herbs, thickened with a little raw force-meat; dip the feet in ‘Vil- leroi’-sauce, to range them one by one on a baking-sheet, and thus let them cool; breadcrumb them twice, fry them in plenty of hot fat, dish them in a group on a folded napkin. 365. Broiled lambs’ feet. Singe a score of lambs’ feet, remove the shaggy parts near the forking of the foot between both the hoofs ; when they are well cleansed, let them boil simply in salted water; drain them, remove only the bone of the leg, but keeping them as whole as possible ; season them, pour on a little oil or melted butter; then sprinkle over a pinch of parsley; let them cool, breadcrumb them, range them on the gridiron, and let them broil for a quarter of an hour on a very slow fire; dish them, and serve separately some cold or warm havigote’- sauce. 366. Stuffed pigs’ feet. Boil four or five well cleansed pigs’ feet with water, salt, some vege- tables, and aromatics; drain them, let them half-cool, in order to split them in two. Bone these halves then, whereupon fill the hollow with a mince of pork, seasoned to high relish, mixed with raw truffles cut in dice. Equalise the force-meat, wrap up each half-foot in a square of pig’s net; let them broil at a slow fire, for three quarters of an hour, and dish them. 367. White ‘boudins’, ‘a la soubise’.

Salted codfish, French way. If the codfish, that is to be used, is dry, it must be left to soiten m cold water for forty-eight hours, changing the water several times ; if it is salt fish in tubs, a few hours of softening will do. — Take two pounds of dissalted codfish, scrape it, divide it in four large squares ; place these squares in a stewpan with cold water, set the stewpan on a brisk, fire; at the first bubbling of the liquid, remove it back to the side; twelve or fifteen minutes after, drain the pieces of codfish, carefully remove their bones, breaking the pieces. . _ On the other hand, chop one white onion, put it into a flat stewpan with butter, let it fry on a slow fire without giving it color ; then add to it the pieces of codfish; immediately take the stewpan off the fire, toss the stewpan, turning it well in order to mix the codfish well with the butter ; when all the butter is absorbed, add some more, but taking only small quantities at a time, until six ounces have been put in, minu doino- so without ceasing to turn the stewpan round; the preparation theifshould be well thickened and creamy; season it with a pinch ot nutmeg finish it with the juice of a lemon, and a little chopped pars ey.

Dish up the lobster, and pour over the sauce. Serve separately a dish of boiled rice. 426. Troncon of salmon with aspic-jelly. Cut a thick piece (troncon) out of the centre of a fresh salmon ; scale it, draw it, then fill the hollow of the belly with a large carrot; wrap it Draw. 143. up in a fine cloth, so that the piece remains whole while boiling. Set the fish on the drainer of the fish-kettle, letting it rest on its belly (see draw. 143), boil it with ‘court-bouillon’, let it cool in its own cooking-stock ; then drain it, unwrap it, remove the carrot from the inside, and set the fish either on a long dish or else on a wooden board, masked with fat or white paper ; coat it with half-set aspic-jelly ; surround it, firstly with chopped aspic-jelly, and then with halves of eggs filled with vegetable - salad; garnish the bottom of the dish with fine ‘croutons’ of aspic-jelly, serve separately some mayonnaise-sauce ‘a la ravigote.’ 427. Lobster in shells. Boil two lobsters in salted water (see art. 47); when they are cold, separate the tails from the bodies ; cut each of the tails in two lengthwise; remove the meat, wipe it, and put it back into the shells, turning it. Draw or pick the bodies, remove all the eatable parts. Open the largeTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 184 claws, cut their flesh into small dice, season them, mix them up with preserved gerkins and beetroot, hard-boiled eggs cut in difce, and at last with whole capers, chopped parsley, and taragon; thicken this salad with a little mayonnaise-sauce, and with it fill the bodies of both the lobsters; decorate the salad on the top, then place the shells on the centre of a dish; surround them with sprigs of parsley, and range all round the claws and halves of tails. — Large crabs may be served accord- ing to the same method, that is to say, boiled, opened, drawn, then filled with their interior, mixed with a salad of preserved vegetables, to which may be added some boiled vegetables seasoned as salad. 428. Gratinated lobster. Boil a lobster (see art. 47); when drained, cleave it lengthwise into two halves ; take the flesh of the tail and claws, and cut it into small dice; put it into a stewpan, mixing an equal quantity of cooked mushrooms, also cut in dice. Pound the coral of the lobster with a little butter, and pass it through a sieve. Reduce a few spoonfuls of good bdcliamel-sauce, introducing into it a little cream and melted glaze ; when ready, add it to the ‘salpicon’ of lobster, keeping the preparation rather stiff, than loose; season with a little cayenne-pepper, and add to it the pounded coral of the lobster. With this preparation, fill the two half-shells of the lobster, pre- viously cleansed ; smoothe it on the top with the blade of a knife ; bread- crumb it, baste with melted butter, salamander it, and seive immediately. 429. Crimped skate. In London the skate is found distributed in strips at the fishmongers; it is generally very white, but its remaining too long in water must be prevented, lest its meat get grainy. The skate cut thus, must simply be boiled in acidulous salted water, and be dished and served, either with caper-sauce, anchovy-sauce, or simply with brown-butter (see art- 143). The liver of the skate is generally in great request; it is boiled like the fish.FISH. — SALMON, LOBSTER. 185 430. Shells of lobster with cream. Cut the flesh of a lobster into small dice, and put them into a kitchen-basm, with a third of their volume of cooked mushrooms, also cut m dice. — Reduce in a stewpan a few spoonfuls of bechamel-sauce gradually introducing a few tablespoonfuls of fish-broth, and some oystei-liquor; the sauce being ready, remove it back, add to it the salpicon’ and a little cayenne-pepper; fill the silver table-shells, sprinkle over them some bread- crumbs, baste them with hot butter, and either push them into the oven to gratmate, or salamander them.

Meanwhile, mix in a small stewpan about a gill of melted meat-glaze, with half its quantity of madeira; boil the liquid, and then remove it Rack. — Work up together, in a kitchen-basin, three tablespoonfuls ot bread-crumb with six ounces of butter, a little cayenne-pepper, and a pinch of chopped parsley. Divide this paste afterwards into small parts, thus adding it to the liquid, without ceasing to stir, so as to obtain a good thick sauce, but without letting it boil; finish the sauce, by intro- ducing into it the creamy substance of the body-shell, pounded and passed through a sieve, and two tablespoonfuls ot good vinegar. The sauce should be rather stiff, than loose; pour it over the lobster, which serve immediately. 433. Fried small fish. Gudgeons, anchovies, sardines, sparlings, small wlutings, and trout: those are the small fish, that may be fried according to the same method, that is, simply flouring them, taking but few at a tune, and plunging them into hot trying-fat. Yet sardines, sparlings, whitings, and trout, may be breadcrumbed with eggs, previous to being tried, sometimes they are simply dipped into beaten eggs, after being floured. — net small fish are generally dished on a folded napkin, and served eitier with fried parsley, or with lemons cut into quarters: they are rarely accompanied by any sauce. 434. Gratinated red-gurnet. The red-gurnet (rouget) is an exception to its species, it is sometimes cooked without being scaled; it is never drawn; its gills only being removed, it is sealed, and bearded. . , ,. Cleanse four or five very fresh fine red-gurnets, eaving the live. inside; slightly salt them, place them, one beside the other, on the bottom of a previously buttered ‘gratin'-dish, sprinkle over a few hand- fuls of chopped fresh mushrooms ; moisten them with a glassful of white- wine; start the liquid to ebullition, and push them into a slack oven,FISH. - SALMON, SARDINES. 187 thus cooking and repeatedly basting them with their own cooking-stock, then drain them, and put the gratin-dish on a remove-dish, the bottom of which is previously masked with a layer of cooked fine-herbs.

Salmon-salad with vegetables. lake a piece of salmon boiled and cooled, remove its skin and bones ; cut the flesh in thin slices, which then season ; pour over oil and vinegar. — Prepare a salad of cooked vegetables (see art. 414), thicken it with two tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise. At serving-time, range the vegetable-salad on a dish; upon this salad then raise the slices of salmon in a pyramid ; mask this pyramid with a layer of mayonnaise with eggs, smoothe it then nicely with the blade of a knife, surround the salad, either with halves of eggs boiled hard, or with seasoned hearts of lettuce. 436. Fried and broiled sardines. Previous to frying sardines, the head must always be torn off, as ■veil as the inside drawn ; scrape them well, wipe them, flour, and plunge ■hem into hot frying-fat; oil being the fat most suitable. — In order toTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK 188 broil sardines, they must be drawn, without removing their heads. Simply wipe them, salt them, pour over a little oil, let them broil at a good tire, turning them; dish them, baste them with oil, or else serve them with housekeeper’s-butter. 437. Gratinated codfish. Take half of a cod-fish, the tail-end, remove both its fillets. Butter a gratin-dish, sprinkle over a pinch of onion and a pinch ot chopped raw mushrooms ; place both the fillets on the dish, one beside the other; season them, also sprinkle over chopped parsley and mushroom, and then some bread-crumb. Thus bake the fish in a hot oven, tor ten or twelve minutes; remove it, baste it with a little good brown-sauce, let it boil for seven or eight minutes more, and serve it on the same dish. 438. Codling. When this fish is prepared quite fresh, its flesh is excellent, and falls in leaves like that ot the cod ; but as soon as it begins to turn, it takes a bad tang, not pleasant to every body. — Boil the codling, like codfish, with salted water, and after it has macerated in salt: serve it with potatoes and melted butter, or else with a sauce applicable to fish. The sauce, as well as the potatoes, must be served separately. 439. Gratin of sole-fillets, with oysters. Take off the fillets of three fine soles, trim them, mask them on one side with a thin layer of raw fish force-meat, prepared with tine- herbs ; when the fillets are masked, fold them together lengthwise. Spread the bottom of a dish with a layer of the same force-meat, ranging it in the shape of a ring, let it get firm in the oven ; on the ring, then dish the fillets of sole, in a circle, and in an upright position; support the circle from the inside, near the centre of the dish, with a layer of force-meat; in the hollow, left by the circle, place either a large carrot, or a piece of bread masked with a buttered piece of paper, just enough to fill the hollow. Surround the fillets also with a strip of buttered paper, and tie this paper on with thread. Set the dish then on a trevet, push itFISH - COD, SOLES, FLOUNDER lgc, into a slack oven, and leave it there for twenty-five minutes ; when taken outot the oven, remove the stanchion, as well as the paper, spunge all the tat off the bottom of the dish, and fill the hollow with oyster-garnish- mask the oysters with a white-sauce, reduced with mushroom-trimmings and the liquor ot the oysters. 440. Slices of cod, with oyster-sauce. Cut two or three slices off a large codfish, fresh and properly c eansed ; put the slices into a basin, sprinkle over a handful of salt let them macerate for half an hour.

Set the dish on the fire; at the first bubbling, push it into a slack oven; bake the fish quite gently for half an hour, basting it with its own cooking-stock; when it is done, serve it on the very same dish. 444. Brill with white wine. The brill being cleansed, split it along its back, all down the length of the principal bone ; place it on a gratin-dish of long form, laying the brown side on the bottom of the dish, which is largely buttered ; moisten it with a bottle of white wine and a little water, salt it; cover the vesse set it on the fire ; give the liquid a few babblings, then remove it back to the side of the fire, and keep it there for twenty or twenty-five minutes The fish done, remove it, and place it on a long dish. Mix into the liquid a piece of kneaded-butler, so as to obtain a light sauce; thicken 1 with a liaison of three yolks of eggs; add to it a pinch of chopped parsley, another of nutmeg, a piece of good butter, divided in little bits ; as soon as the butter is dissolved, pour the sauce on the fish. 445.

On the other hand, take two handfuls of plucked small onions, put them into a skillet with butter, salt, and a pinch of sugar; color them, cook them, and glaze them with little broth. — As soon as the fish is done, remove the pieces of carp, range them in another stewpan with the glazed onions; pass the stock through a sieve, put it back into the stewpan, let it boil, thicken it with a piece of kneaded-butter, divided into little bits. Boil the sauce for a few minutes, add two tablespoonfuls of rum, pour it on the fish, which let simmer in this sauce for seven or eight minutes. Now dish the pieces of fish : the bottom of the dish must be masked with fried bread-Aroutons’; surround the carp with the fried onions; finish the sauce, introducing into it a piece of butter, pour it on the fish. — In order to prepare a very rich ‘matelote’, the fish must be of mixed species, such as : pike, eel, and carp. For a garnish, maybe used mushrooms, soft-roes, and even stoned and blanched olives. 463. Pike, with horseradish-sauce. Choose a fine river-pike, scale it, pouring some hot water over, or else passing the thin blade of a knife between the scales and uppermost skin: a very easy proceeding. Draw it, making an aperture in the belly, cut the fins, notch the meat on both sides ; sprinkle the fish largely with salt, let it macerate thus for half an hour ; wash it then, truss its head, set it on the drainer of a fish-kettle ; add to it some salt, minced vege- tables, a large bunch of parsley, a glassful of vinegar, and the water requisite to cover it; set the vessel on the fire, let the liquid boil; imme- diately remove it back to the side of the fire, always keeping it at the same degree of heat, but without allowing it to boil; if the fish weighs four to six pounds, give it one hour's cooking; if much larger, it requires half an hour more. The pike being done, remove it on the drainer of the fish-kettle, let it drain, slip it then on a long dish ; surround it with green parsley, and potatoes boiled in water ; serve separately a hot liorseradish-sauce (see art. 147).FISH . — PIKE, SHAH. 199 464.

Fried smelts. Choose smelts of an equal size, and quite fresh ; scrape them, draw b<y gills, without tearing the belly, and without removing the ver and roes ; remove their tins, wash them quickly, drain them on a eve; salt, and flour them, taking but few at a time, without wiping them;THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 210 dip them into beaten eggs, breadcrumb them, plunge them immediately into hot frying-fat; when they are of a fine color, and dry on theii out- side, drain them, salt, and dish them. 490. Broiled conger-eel. Take up both the fillets of a thick piece of conger-eel, cleanse them, cut them transversally in thin slices ; let them macerate for an hour w ith salt and vinegar; drain, and spunge them on a cloth; season, and ioil them in oil, then in bread-crumb; range them on a gridiron, let them broil at a moderate fire, basting and turning them ; dish them; serve, at the same time, either a piquant-sauce, or a tartar-sauce. 491. Oysters with white-sauce (a la poulette). Open a few dozen oysters, blanch them with a little white wine; preserve the liquor, wash them, drain them on a cloth, trim them. — Chop an onion, put it into a stewpan with butter, fry it, without allowing it to take color, sprinkle over a large spoonful of flour; fry the flour for two minutes, stirring it; dilute it then, gradually, and off the Are, with the liquor of the oysters, and with broth, so as to obtain a sauce of nice consistence. At the first bubbling, remove it to the side; add to it a bunch of parsley, and some peppercorns; let the sauce clarify for a quarter of an hour; skim off its fat, pass it through a sieve into another stewpan, in order to thicken it with a liaison of three yolks of eggs ; mix into it the oysters, add to it the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of parsley. Serve the stew. 492. Oysters with fine - herbs. Blanch five or six dozen oysters (see art. 48) ; drain them, presen - mg their liquor; beard, and wash them. - Fry in a stewpan, with butter, three tablespoonfuls of chopped onions and slialots, to u m i add seven or eight spoonfuls of fresh mushrooms, also chopped ; let then- moisture reduce, moisten them with a little broth, and a part of the liquor of the oysters; boil the tine-herbs a few minutes, and thicken them with a small piece of kneaded-butter ; then add the oysters ; at the211 FISH. — CRAYFISH, SEA-CRAYFISH. first bubbling, thicken the sauce with a liaison of two yolks of eggs, finish it with the juice of a lemon, a pinch of cayenne-pepper, and another of chopped parsley; with this garnish till eight or nine table-shells ; mask their upper surface with a light layer of bread-crumb fried with butter; serve thus the shells. 493.

Pass the liquid, reduce it to half, mix it with a piece of butter, pour it over the crayfish. 495. Crayfish omelet. Cut into dice two or three dozen boiled Cray fish-tails. Chop the flesh of the claws, together with the trimmings of the tails, and an equal volume of fresh mushrooms; put them into a kitchen - basin, bieak into this basin ten fresh eggs; season them with salt and nutmeg, add a pinch of chopped parsley, beat them with a whip for some moments. Warm five ounces of butter in an omelet-pan, mix into it the beaten eggs; thicken the omelet, place on its centre the warmed crayfish-tails, mixed with a tablespoonful of white-sauce, reduced with a little meat-glaze. Roll then the omelet up to a ‘porte-manteau’, and turn it out on a smalL oblong dish. 496. Stewed fresh herrings. The great merit of this manner of preparation is, that in cooking,, all the hones of the herrings disappear. - Cut off the heads from quite fresh and properly cleansed herrings; range them in layers, into an earthen stock-pot; season each of the layers. - Mince some carrots and onions, let them fry with butter ; add to them a few peppercorns, a clove of garlic, and a bunch of parsley; moisten these vegetables with white wine, in a sufficient quantity to cover the herrings ; let the liquid boil, remove it to the side of the fire; half an hour after, pass it, through a sieve on to the herrings; cover the vessel, lute its jointures; boil the herrings on a very slow fire, for five hours, without touching them; serve them either hot or cold. 497. Crayfish-salad with aspic-jelly. Boil four or five dozen small crayfish (see art. 47); when they hav< cooled, disengage their tails and large claws, which pluck; put then into a kitchen-basin, and season them, baste them with a little oil an.213 FISH. — HERRINGS, CRAYFISH. vinegar. Cut then the trimmings, mix them, as well as the flesh of the claws, into a vegetable-salad, cut in small dice, seasoned and thickened with a little mayonnaise - sauce. — Surround a border-mould with pounded ice. Take four eggs boiled hard, cut each of them in two, dip them, on one side, into a little half-set aspic-jelly; range them in the border-mould, setting them in an upright position, their pointed Draw. 161. end directed to the bottom, and the cut side to the sides of the mould. A few minutes after, fill the mould with the aspic-jelly, which allow to set. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, turn the border out on a cold dish. Dish the salad in a pyramid into the hollow of the border, and smoothe it with the blade of the knife. Then take the crayfish-tails, one by one, with a larding-needle, and range them, in circles one above the other, on the salad. Stick a ‘hatelet’-skewer on the top, garnished with a truffle and a crayfish ; serve at the same time a boatful of mayon- naise-sauce. 498. Broiled fresh herrings. Fresh herring is a highly estimated dish ; it is excellent; its flesh, although with bones, yet is delicate and light; particularly in autumn, this fish excels in all its good qualities : soft-roe herrings being the most appreciated. — Slightly scrape eight or ten herrings; draw them by their gills, quickly wash them, spunge them; wipe the soft-roes, salt them,214 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-LOOK. bring them back into the belly of the fish ; place the fish on a dish, sprinkle over salt, pour over a little oil, let them broil at a slow fire-, turn them, and six or seven minutes after, dish them ; pour over a little housekeeper’s-butter, or else serve separately a mustard-sauce, that is some butter-sauce finished with a little good mustard. 499. Salted herrings. These herrings indeed cannot be partaken of, unless freshly salted; if old, they have no good qualities, no value at all: salted herrings constitute an aperitive and healthful dish. — Wash a few salted herrings, let them soak in cold milk for three or four hours ; drain them, remove the heads of each, divide the body into thick pieces (trongons), which range on a dish; surround them with minced onions, preserved gerkins cut in thin slices, and then with a handful of whole capers ; baste them with oil and vinegar, then serve them thus. 500. Red-herrings, ‘a la Flamande’. Red-herrings are excellent, if they are smoked to the degiee lequi- site, and smoked recently: in getting old their flesh gets pungent, and loses its good qualities. — Cut off the heads of the heilings, slightly split the back, hlave boiling a large stewpan of water, range the her- rings on a gridiron, which place in a stewpan, exposing the herrings to the steam of the water kept boiling, turn the herrings, take them out, as soon as the skin can be disengaged from them ; remove the skin, and the soft-roes, cut away the thin parts of the belly ; dish the herrings and soft-roes, pour over some housekeeper’s-butter, mixed with a table- spoonful of good mustard. 501. Preserved red-lierrings. Cut off the heads of a dozen smoked herrings, range the latter in a stewpan, moisten them to cover with tepid water; set the stewpan on the fire, keep it thus, till the water be quite warm; cover the stewpan, take it off the fire. Half an hour after, drain the herrings, remove their skin,FISH. - HERRINGS, MUSCLES. 215 range them in a vessel with a cover to it; let them macerate for two days, previous to eating them. Let me recommend this simple preparation. 502. Red-herrings with fine-herbs. Remove the head from a dozen good red-herrings, split the backs, in order to open them; disengage the fillets, remove the soft-roes; take out the bones of the flesh, which let soak in milk for some hours, as well as the soft-roes. — Let fry some spoonfuls of tine-herbs (see art. 41) with mushroom; when their moisture is reduced, mix them with a large handful of bread-crumb, and a spoonful of chopped parsley. — Drain the fillets of the red-herrings, as well as the soft-roes; remove the skin from off the fillets, which range on a ‘gratin’-dish, previously f sprinkled with the prepared fine-herbs; on these fine-herbs now range a layer of herring-fillets, intermingled with soft-roes; again sprinkle over tine-herbs, pour over a little melted butter ; continue alternating herrings and fine-herbs ; sprinkle over the top a pinch of bread-crumb, let the herrings gratinate in the oven ; when they are taken out, pour over the juice of two lemons, and serve immediately. 503. Muscles, with wine. Cleanse the muscles, drain them. Chop an onion and a few shalots, put them into a stewpan with butter, fry them without allowing them to take color; then moisten with a glassful of white wine ; give the liquid two bubblings, add to it the muscles, boil them on a brisk fire, the stewpan kept covered, and tossing them. Immediately when they have opened, drain them on a colander, preserving their liquor. Remove half of the shells, put them back into the same stewpan with their liquor, a pinch of pepper, and a large piece of butter, divided in little bits. Toss the muscles till the butter is melted, sprinkle over a little chopped parsley, and serve them. 504. Muscles, ‘a la matelote’. Choose a few dozen good fresh muscles, properly cleansed, soaked, and washed, changing the water several times ; put them into a stewpan,216 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. toss them over the tire till they have opened, and throw them on a colander, placed on a stewpan, so as to be able to gather the liquor; remove half of the shells, that is, all those to which the flesh of the muscles does not stick. — Put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalots, as well as a whole clove of garlic, not being plucked; fry them with butter, without allowing them to take color; add the muscles, a glassful of white wine, and the liquor of the muscles; let the liquid boil for a few minutes, thicken it with a piece of butter, kneaded with fresh bread- crumb, chopped parsley, and a pinch of cayenne-pepper ; toss the muscles off the fire, until the butter be dissolved, and serve them immediately. The saucepans, of which the drawing (162) is presented on the next page (217), are of copper, tinned inside, and with straight handles, whiclk| is the usual English way : these saucepans have nothing particular in their shape, the cover alone distinguishes them : that on the left has the cover slightly raised, that on the right has it somewhat sunken or depressed, the middle smaller one quite flat. In small kitchens, where the utensils are not always over numerous, saucepans with raised covers are preferable; for this cover, turned upside down, becomes a saute-pan : an advantage, this, facilitating kitchen-work. .juju-BUTCHER’S MEAT. Butcher’s iue;it is of various nature; some sorts beino- white, others brown : beef and mutton belong to one side; pork, veal, and lamb, to the other. Hut the one, as well as the other, may Draw. 162. be served at a dinner as a remove, that is, appearing after the fish. I speak here of large pieces ; as with butcher’s meat various dishes are prepared, that cannot be served as removes; such as brains, kidneys, ears, and feet of mutton or lamb, and many other compounded or mixed dishes. Butcher’s meat is admitted to all dinners. At luncheon, rigorously taken, butcher’s meat may be left unserved; but for a dinner it cannot be dispensed with, as by its substantial, and nutritive qualities, butcher’s meat is highly appreciated by the guests generally. Moreover it is an established rule, to serve218 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. some piece of butcher’s meat, whether braised or roasted, or even boiled ; and this rule ought to be respected. At a common daily family-dinner, where the fare is mostly composed of two or three dishes only, the piece of butcher’s meat may stand for the roast, although it does not till up the place of it. But at a dinner, where there are guests, not belonging to the family, that is, at a dinner comparatively of etiquette, the piece of butcher’s meat, even when roast, must yet preserve all the character of a remove, and is served at the outstart of the dinner, without prejudice to the roast proper, which must be of necessity composed of poultry or game. 505. Little balls of beef. Take a piece of boiled and cooled beef, remove its hard parts; chop the meat, mix into it a third its volume of bread-crumb, softened with broth, then well pressed out; then two tablespoonfuls ot chopped onion, fried with butter; add to it salt, spices, a pinch of chopped parsley; thicken this hash with a few yolks ot eggs; then take it up in pieces ot the size of an egg, round them, rolling them on the floured table ; flatten them, dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them; give them color on both sides in a frying-pan, with butter; dish them in a group, or else round a vegetable-garnish. 506. Devil broiled beef. Cut into not over thin slices the end of a boiled, or braised, but cold, rump of beef; trim these slices, without removing their fat; salt, and roll them in oil, mixed with mustard and pepper, the lattei piedo- minating; apply then each of these slices on a layer of grated bread- crumb, and range them on a gridiron; warm them on a slow tire, basting them with oil, with the aid ot a little bunch ot parsley, sei\ing a^ a paste-brush. When the slices are quite warm, and slightly colored, dish them ; pour on the bottom of the dish a little good gravy.219 BUTCHER'S MEAT. - RUMP, AND RIBS, OF. BEEF. 507. Broiled rump of beef, garnished. The drawing facing this article, represents a rump of beef, raw, boned, and trimmed square.— Take a piece of rump of beef, bone it, roll it up, tie it with thread, put it into the stock-pot, cover it largely with cold water; add to it the salt requisite, let the liquid boil, skimming it carefully; at the first bubbling, remove it back to the side of the lire; garnish the stock-pot with vegetables, and roots, as for a stock-pot-soup; Draw. 163. boil the meat for live or six hours, according to its bulk : the rump requires generally a long time cooking; it must be served, boiled free of excess, yet without being hard : the meat must remain juicy. As soon as the piece is drained, trim it properly, and dish it; sur- round it with a garnish of vegetables,, boiled separately. Lettuce and cabbage, braised, are suitable, as well as sour-crout and potato-puree. If the piece is to be served without a garnish, it may be surrounded with green parsley ; in any case, a tomata-sauce, a piquant-sauce, or simply a •good thickened gravy, can be served separately. 508. Ribs of beef, roasted or braised. If the piece of rib is to be roasted, the chine (chaine), ridge- or back- bone, by which the ribs are held together, must simply be cut off, and the piece tied with thread ; the operation is just as for a roast sirloin, observ-220 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. ing, that this part of the loin requires proportionally always longer time for cooking. A piece of ribs must be accompanied by potatoes. In order to braise a piece of the ribs, the chine-bone must be disengaged, and the flap kept rather shorty tie the meat uith tin cad, let it braise according to the common method (see art. 511). — A piece of braised rib may be served accompanied by a garnish of vegetables, by a puree, or by macaroni. — If the piece is garnished, the gravy of the cooking-stock must be served separately. 509. Brisket of beef, salted. Salt brisket of beef is by no means a luxurious dish; but, nevertheless, a very excellent one. It the beef be salted at home, it must be left in the souse for a fortnight at least. — Previously to preparing the brisket, let it soak in cold water for a few hours; then boil it in water, just as tor ham. Four hours after, take the stewpan off the fire; keep the meat m the cooking-stock for one hour more; drain it, remove the bones, and dish it with a little gravy over it: serve separately a puree of dry pease, or else potato-puree, or even a garnish of sour-crout. 510. Beefsteak-pie, with oysters. Cut six or seven thin slices out of the sirloin or tender-loin (fillet) of beef, beat them, season them with salt and pepper; flour them, and range them in a pie-dish; surround them with two dozen blanched oysters. Pour on the bottom of the dish a little cold gravy, finish the pie, proceeding, as indicated, art. 536 ; bake it for an hour and a quarter. 511. Braised rump of beef. The part called rump of beef is that part of the quarter following the sirloin on the side of the tail; it is the most delicate piece of the ox, the best, the most distinguished one to be boiled or braised. It braised, the rump of beef should always be kept well hung, till quite tender, and before cooking rolled up, and bound with thread. — Choose a long stewpan of the dimensions of the piece of meat; mask the bottom vith221 BEEF. — BRISKET, RUMP, SIRLOIN. some trimmings of fat, and some sliced onions ; set the meat on the bot- tom, season it, surround it with a few carrots, a bunch of parsley and aromatics; moisten it with two glassfuls of broth; cover the stewpan, set it on a moderate tire, and let the liquid reduce to glaze ; again moisten the liquid, to the same height, with broth, of which the fat has not been skimmed, and with a little white wine; cover it with a greased paper; remove it to a slow tire, or else to the entrance of the oven; thus boil the meat for six hours, and more if the piece be voluminous, but notice Draw. 1G4. carefully to remove the fat off the cooking-stock from time to time, and to lighten it with a little broth while it is reducing. When the meat is done, it must be of a line color, quite savory and succulent. At serving-time, drain the piece of beef, trim its upper surface as well as both ends, in order to give it a regular shape; at last dish it, and surround it with a garnish of cabbage, carrots, or small onion. — This piece can also be served with a garnish of macaroni. Skim well the fat off the cooking-stock, which pass through a sieve, slightly thicken with a little tomata-sauce, or else with brown-sauce. Serve it separately in a sauceboat. 512. Roastbeef. Roastbeef, that is the sirloin, is that part of the ox, running from the junction of the leg and loin, up to the last ribs. The best piece of roasting beef is the one situated not too near the ribs, nor yet too near the rump of the ox ; it ought to be taken out of the middle of222 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. the sirloin. The piece represented by the drawing 165, is taken off this part; but in order to obtain a good, tender, juicy piece of roasting beef, the meat must absolutely be of high quality, and coming from a fat young animal; the piece especially must above all be kept hung to the requisite degree of tenderness : roastbeef, even if coming from a young animal, would yet be tough and hard, if the meat were not hung, till sufficiently tender. If the piece of beef is to be roasted on the common spit, pierce the piece, transversally or lengthways, according to its thickness, just above the bone, which separates the large and the minion fillet; support the Draw. 165. roasting beef by two iron-skewers, one placed on the top, the othei underneath. If the beef can be roasted on a cradle-spit, the opeiation by this proceeding is highly simplified. But if no spit be at disposal, the roasting beef can be roasted in the oven, on a roasting-pan, or else on a large baking-sheet with upturned rim; in order to ensure the success of the operation, the roasting beef must be placed on a gridiron set on the baking-sheet, but elevated enough to hinder the fat of the baking-sheet reaching to the height of the meat. A piece of roasting beef, baked in these conditions, basted frequently, turned now and then, gives excellent results. If the roasting beef is roasted on the spit, it must be none the less basted repeatedly with the fat of the dripping-pan, but taking care to use only the fat, foi if a piece of roasting beef is basted with fat mixed with watery particles, one runs a risk of producing a very bad roast. A piece of beef weighing eight or ten pounds, if prepared in the223 BEEF. - BOLL, AND BIBS, BBAISED, AND SALTED oven, or on the spit, will require one hour and a half, if the action of the lire is well directed, and kept up. Brown meat when roasted, (such as beef, and mutton), requires to be kept under-done, being then more tender and juicy. The roastbeef must be disengaged of its paper, a quarter of an hour previous to being taken off the spit, and must not be salted, till the moment of being taken off the spit. Roastbeef, when done, must be served on a large dish, without gravy, or garnish : if the meat is meant to be carved at the table, the garnish, as well as gravy, are served separately. The garnishes to be served with roastbeef consist most com- monly of yorkshire-pudding, potatoes, boiled in steam, or else with salted water ; beside these, other vegetables are also served, however, such as Brussels-sprouts, cauliflowers, french-beans, etc. 513. Braised roll of beef, with nouilles. Cut half of a sirloin of beef, bone it entirely, cut it straight at the side ot the tat, then lard the lean meat interiorly with seasoned fillets of bacon, bet the piece in a large kitchen-basin, season it, moisten it with a glassful ot white wine; mix up with it some minced vegetables, as well as a 5unch of aromatics, and let it macerate thus, for at least six hours. Ihen roll the meat up, bind it with thread, and let it braise, proceeding as sa^ ai't. 511 ; when it is done, it should prove glazed to a fine color, and its cooking-stock should be succulent.224 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Dish the piece, surround it with a garnish of ‘nouilles’ seasoned with parmesan-cheese, and thickened with a little sauce and butter; pass the cooking-stock of the meat through a sieve, skim its tat, and sei\e it separately. This piece may be garnished, with vegetable-puree, or any other vegetable garnish, as well as with any of the composed garnishes, described in the chapter of elementary methods. 514. Ribs of beef braised, with macaroni. Cut a thick piece off the ribs, from the covered part; cut short the bones of the ribs; cut off also the back-bone; place the meat in a stew- pan the bottom of which is masked with vegetables, and remains of bacon ; season it, let it braise, according to the common method, for three or four hours. When the meat is done, it should prove ot a nice color, and the cooking-stock be succulent; pass the latter, skim off itb fat, pour the cooking-stock then into a sauceboat; drain the meat, dish it up, surround it with a garnish of macaroni with parmesan, and serve. 515. Salted roll of beef. The sirloin of beef, boned according to the method described in the art. 33, and salted for fourteen or eighteen days, constitutes an excellent remove, especially if the meat be chosen of good qualities, and is boiled immediately after being taken out of the souse. Previous to cooking the meat, let it be washed; then cut it straight on the side, roll it up, and bind it with thread ; put it into a large vessel, cover it completely with cold water, add to it some vegetables, and let the liquid boil; at the first bubbling, remove it to the side of the fire, so that it only simmer gently ; three hours after, remove the vessel off the fire, so that the liquid ceases to boil, but yet remains warm ; two hours after, the meat should prove well done. . A piece of salted beef, served as a remove, must be accompanied by a good brown-sauce, and a garnish of fresh or dry vegetables, accord- ing to the season.225 BEEF-STEAKS, BROILED, OR FRIED. 516. Broiled beefsteaks with marrow. In order to obtain them succulent, the steaks absolutely must be cut out ot the centie ot a fillet, hung till tender to the degree requisite • steaks cut out of the end or head-piece of the fillet being almost always dry. Ihe demonstration is here given, for comparison, of a trimmed beefsteak and of another untrimmed one. — Saw a marrow-bone asunder, in two 01 tinee pieces, which let soak 5 put them into a stewpan with >r°th, boil them on a slow fire for three quarters of an hour. — Cut the >eefsteaks, giving them the thickness of about half an inch ; remove the chain’, trim them of their sinewy skin, round them, leaving a little fat •n the side ; slightly beat them ; season them with salt and pepper ; roll bem in melted butter, or in oil, range them side by side on a gridiron; 3t them broil at a good fire for twelve minutes, notice turning them; ake them out immediately, when the meat, if pressed with the finger, ffers a slight resistance ; dish them crossways ; place between each of oem a fine slice of cooked beef-marrow, seasoned with a little cayenne- eppei, and glazed with the paste-brush ; also glaze the beefsteaks, but erve them without gravy. — Broiled beefsteaks may also be served with garnish of potatoes, or cresses. — The art of broiling beefsteak is ot an operation apt to succeed at first: it requires to be studied with reat attention. nl7. Beefsteaks with onions. Cut and trim some beefsteaks, keeping them a little thinner than lose meant to be broiled ; season them with salt and pepper. — Mince vo or three onions, spread them on the bottom of a thin flat stewpanTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKEliY-BOOK. 226 buttered; fry them at a good tire, turning them repeatedly : the onions and the beefsteaks must be done at the same time. Remove the beef- steaks, with the aid of a fork, dish them, then moisten the onions with a little thickened gravy; two minutes after, pour them over the beefsteaks. 518. Cushion of beef with aspic-jelly. Cut off half a cushion of beef, remove its bones, lard the meat interiorly with fillets of bacon and raw ham; season it, put it into a kitchen-basin, moisten it with half a bottle of white wine, add to it some aromatics, a bunch of parsley, whole spices; let it macerate in this seasoning for two or three days, after which drain it, bind it with thread, place it in an earthen stock-pot (of just its dimension), the bottom of which is masked with bacon and minced large vegetables ; add to it two boned, and blanched calf s-feet, cut up ; moisten the meat to cover with the marinade, boil the liquid, and remove the stock-pot back on hot ashes; cover it with a round of paper, then with a common deep plate, half-filled with water; boil the meat quite gently for seven hours, then dram it, untruss it, put it into a narrow basin for cooling, placing a slight weight on. ' On the other hand, lighten the cooking-stock with a little broth, pass it through a sieve, carefully skim the fat, clarify it with a little lean chopped beef, a whole egg and a little white wine, proceeding as is said in the art. 130; then pass the jelly through a napkin. — When the meat has well cooled, turn it out, place it on a dish, whole or carved, surround it with cold jelly, having got firm on the iee, and cut m ‘croutons . 519. Carved fillet of beef, ‘a la Providence’. Trim a fine fillet, which lard all over with bacon; place it in a roastine-pan, the bottom of which is masked with the remains of bacon and some chopped beef-fat; very slightly salt it, cover it with a sheet o buttered paper, and pour over a good ladleful of stock-pot iat {degr^m,- An hour pilous to serving, push the fillet into the oven, baste .1 repeatedly with its own cooking-stock, drain it as soon as done, thenBEEF. - CUSHION, FILLET, RUMP-STEAK. 221 carve it ‘en entaille’, and thus dish it; then range, on both ends of the fillet, a garnish ‘a la Providence’, slightly basted with brown-sauce ; glaze the fillet with the paste-brush; and serve separately the remainder of the sauce. My object in giving this drawing was to demonstrate the manner of carving a beef-fillet, previous to its being presented to the guests. For this operation the centre-part of the fillet must be disengaged in the Draw. 16!). diiection represented in the drawing, then the part removed is carved, and brought back into its place ; by this proceeding the fillet absolutely loses nothing of its physiognomy, and has the appearance of being whole: this is the manner called carving ‘en entaille’. The same proceeding may be also applied to other pieces ot butcher’s meat. 520. Rump-steak, Bearn-sauce. To get good rump-steaks, a good rump of beef taken off a young- animal, of excellent breed, must be at one’s disposal. — Transver- sally cut, off the pointed end of a rump of beef, some slices, half an inch thick; season them with salt and pepper, roll them in melted butter, and let them broil on both sides at a moderate fire, turning them, but keeping them under-done; dish them, glaze them with the aid of the paste-brush, and surround them with a Bearn-sauce. 521. Tripe (gras-double) with onions. Choose a thick white piece of ox-tripe ; let it soak, put it then into a stewpan with water, which warm till starting to ebullition ; then drain 15*228 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. the tripe, carefully scrape its spungy surface, wash it, changing the water repeatedly; then cut it into large squares; place these squares in a stewpan, or earthen stock-pot, with a sufficient quantity ot water to cover it; add to it a little salt, an onion, and a hunch of parsley garnished with aromatics ; let the liquid boil, remove it back to the side of the fire ; continue a very gentle ebullition for seven or eight hours, keeping the vessel covered. When the tripe is done, refresh it in cold water, spunge it well, distribute it in long squares (one inch wide). — Mince two large onions, put them into a frying-pan with butter, let them fry quite gently, till they be slightly colored ; then add the tripe, season it with salt and pepper, boil it, until the onion is well set, and the tripe of a fine color; finish it with a drop of vinegar, or the juice of two lemons, and a little chopped parsley. , _ .. _ 522. Tripe ‘a la poulette’. Cut, in long squares a pound, or more, of boiled tripe. Chop a large onion, let it fry with butter in a stewpan; when it is of a fine yellow color, add to it the cut tripe, which season; let it fry, till its moisture has reduced ; then sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour, gradually moisten it with warm broth ; stir the liquid until ebullition, add to it a garnished bunch of parsley ; two minutes after, remove it on a slow fire, boil it for twenty-five minutes; then remove the tripe with the fork, place it in another stewpan, let the sauce reduce to the degree requisite, stirring it; thicken it with a liaison of three yolks of eggs, strain it over the tripe. Finish the stew, introducing into it a piece of butter, a pinch of parsley, .another of pepper, another of nutmeg, and the juice of a lemon. 523. Middle-piece (troncon) of beef-fillet, braised, ‘a la jardiniere’. A whole fillet of beef constitutes a very copious dish, not well to be served, unless at a dinner of many guests; for a dinner, where the number of guests is a restricted one, it is convenient to serve but half of it, or a piece taken out of the centre of the fillet; moreover, both theBEEF. — TRIPE, ROAST FILLET. 229 extremities ot the fillet, that remain at disposal, that is, the head and end may be very usefully employed for the preparation of little fancy-dishes' which are of high value for the ordinary fare of a household; such as Tournedos’, ‘paupiettes’, or a beefsteak-pie. Take the centre part of a trimmed and larded fillet of beef; place the meat in a long stewpan, the bottom of which must be masked with tiimmings of bacon, onions and carrots, cut in thick slices ; slightly salt Draw. 17.1. the meat, moisten it, to half its height, with broth and white wine ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, let the liquid reduce to glaze ; moisten the meat again to the same height with broth ; cover the stewpan, remove it back to a slow fire; finish braising the meat, basting it repeatedly ; it will require an hour and a half, or two hours. At serving-time, drain the fillet, slightly trim it on its upper surface, dish it, either kept whole or carved; surround it with a gardener’s garnish. Pass its cooking-stock through a sieve, skim off its fat, thicken it with a little tomata-sauce, let it reduce to the degree requisite, and serve it separately. 524.

Slightly salt the fillet, take it off the230 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. spit, dish it, and surround it with fried potatoes ; serve at the same time a piquant-sauce, mixed with the stock ol the dripping-pan, the fat of which has been removed. 525. Beef-muzzle, piquant-sauce. The piece called muzzle of beef, is that soft part situated at the end of the muzzle, to which the palate is left adhering; muzzle of beef is a great resource for the kitchen of the middle-class; as it is cheap, and excellent, if well prepared. — Singe a muzzle of beef, let it soak for a few hours, put it into a stewpan with water, let the liquid boil; then drain the muzzle, spunge it, scrape its inside, in order to disengage the white skin ; let it boil, proceeding as prescribed for calf’s head, but care- fully removing the fillet of the palate, as soon as it is done. When the ox-muzzle is done to the degree requisite, drain it, cut it, as well as the palate, into middling-sized squares, which put into a stewpan ; moisten them to nearly their height with a piquant-sauce, or a chopped - sauce; let the stew simmer on a very slow fire for a quarter of an hour, an then dish it. 526. Bullock’s-heart, a la daube. Cut into large squares the heart of an ox ; remove the blood, wipe it then lard it with fillets of raw ham and bacon ; put it into a kitchen- basin, season it with salt and pepper, pour over a glassful of white wine. Let the meat macerate for a few hours. - Chop half a pound of bacon let it melt in an earthen stock-pot, add it to the meat well drained , le it fry for ten or fifteen minutes ; then add to it the stock of the marinade, a bunch of aromatics, and a few small onions. Cover the stock-pot with a round of strong paper, then with a plate ; remove it back on hot ashes boil the meat for three hours on a slow fire. At serving- .me, dish the meat; skim the fat off its stock, add to it a small handful of presene capers, pour it over the meat, after having removed the bunch. 527. ‘Grenadine* of beef-fillet.

Let the liquid boil for five or six minutes, pass it then through a sieve ; thicken it Avith a piece of kneaded- butter; give it one bubbling. Dish these ‘grenadins’, and pour the sauce all round. 528. Taupiettes’ of beef-fillet. Cut, off the head-piece of a trimmed fillet of beef, some slices, rather long, than wide; beat these slices Avith the flat part of a chopper, trim them square, and to an equal shape ; season and mask them on one side, with a thin layer of veal-force-meat, mixed up Avith a little cooked fine- herbs ; roll them up, so as to shut up the force-meat; tie them with thread, range them in a flat stewpan, let them fry in butter for a feAV minutes; moisten them Avith broth, which let reduce to glaze ; add a little Avhite Avine and broth ; let the ‘paupiettes’ be braised on a sIoav fire, and short of moisture, for twenty-five minutes ; they should then prove avcII glazed; untruss them, and dish them; lighten their cooking- stock with a little thickened gravy, and pass it, through a sieA7e, over the ‘paupiettes’. 529. Marrow-bones. Sa\vr asunder the bones of tAvo legs of beef, into thick pieces of equal length (three or four inches); scrape the surface of the bones, in order to cleanse them well, let them soak then in cold Avater, and put them side by side, but not in an upright position ; cover them largely Avith broth of the stock-pot; let the liquid boil, immediately remove it back to the232 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. side of the tire, letting it boil there for an hour and a halt. At serving- time, drain the bones, dish them on a napkin. Serve separately a plate of bread-toast, broiled, and still hot. 530. Pickled-tongue, sour-sweet sauce. If one wishes to have tongues salted at home, it is best to salt several at a time ; choose them fresh, trim them, rub them with fine salt, till the meat be softened. Place the tongues on a baking-sheet, one beside the other, with a weight on ; twenty-four hours after, range them in layers in a wooden tub, or else in a wedgewood-pan; cover them with cooked and cooled souse {see art. 33), cover the vessel with a cloth, and thus keep it in a cool place. Every second day turn the tongues, placing those uppermost on the bottom. Twelve or fifteen days after, drain one tongue, let it soak, and boil it in water for three hours; drain it again, remove its skin, glaze it with the paste-brush, dish it, mask it with piquant-sauce, finished with currant-jelly and small raisins. 531. Pickled ox-tongue, chestnut-puree. Boil in water a pickled tongue; when it is tender, drain it; then remove its skin, place the tongue in a stewpan with a little wine and melted meat-glaze; let the liquid reduce ; when the tongue is glazed to the degree requisite, and has taken a nice color, dish it on a chestnut- puree of nice consistence ; mix into the cooking-stock a little broth, let it boil, skim off its fat, pass it through a sieve, let it reduce to half-glaze, pour it over the pickled tongue. 532. Baked beef-fillet, studded with truffles. Trim a good fillet of beef; stud its surface with truffles ; mask it with strips of bacon, and set it on a narrow baking-sheet with upturned rim, the bottom of which is masked with trimmings of bacon and vegetables, as well as aromatics ; moisten it with a glassful of wine, then bake it in a slack oven, for nearly an hour, basting it repeatedly.r BEEF. - PICKLED TONGUE. 233 Taking the fillet out of the oven, drain it well, dish it, and surround it with a garnish, composed of larded sweetbreads, ox-piths (amourettes), aiid farced onion ; these garnishes are dished in groups.

Take a good tine beef-fillet, kept hung to the requisite degree of tenderness, trimmed and larded (see art. 32); mask the bottom of a loasting- pan, or else a baking-sheet, with chopped beef-fat, and some minced vegetables ; set the fillet then upon these vegetables, salt, and moisten it with a glassful of broth ; cover the meat with a buttered sheet of paper; push it into a slack oven, and roast it for three quarters of an hour, or for one hour, at the most, according to its size, but repeatedly basting it with its melted fat; drain it, place it on a dish, and baste it with Chateau- briand sauce (see art. 181) ; serve separately a vegetable-garnish. 535. ‘Tournedos’, Bearn-sauce. Take a piece of beef-fillet off the side of the head-piece; cut the meat slantwise, down the length of the fillet, into thin slices; slightly beat them, trim them to an equal shape, season, and place them on a dish; pour over some oil and lemon-juice, sprinkle over a minced onion,- and a few sprigs of parsley; let them macerate thus for two hours, turning them. — Warm some butter, and oil, m a flat and thin stewpan; rano-e these ‘tournedos’ in the stewpan one beside the other, let them try on a brisk fire, turning them; when they are at the degree requisite, drain off their fat, pour over a little liquid glaze; try them tor two minutes more, then dish them, in a circle, and pour into the middle a Bearn-sauce (see art. 168.) 536. Beefsteak-pudding. Line a pudding-basin with suet-paste (see art. 52). Cut some thin slices of beef (two pounds), such as for a pie.

Shut the pudding up with a flat of the same paste, soldering t carefully. Wrap the pudding-basin up in a cloth, plunge it into boiling vater, boil the pudding for two hours at least, then serve it. 537. Beefsteak-pie. Cut a piece of fillet of beef,‘into very small steaks, which season with salt and pepper. Mask the bottom of a pie-dish with a layer of raw ootatoes, peeled and cut in slices ; season these slices also ; then range he small beefsteaks on these potato- slices ; add to them a few quarters ff eggs boiled hard; slip on the oottorn of the dish a little good cold gravy. Moisten the edges of the lisli with a little water, mask them with a strip of puff-paste; moisten dso this paste. Prepare a thin round flat, likewise of puff-paste ; with this flat then cover the meat of the pie; oress on the flat to the rim of the dish, cut the paste with the aid of a xnife, notch it all round it edges; make a small hole on the centre of :he dome, place all round this hole a rosette of leaves imitated in paste, bet the pie on a baking-sheet, push it into a slack oven ; a quarter of an roar after, cover it with paper, bake it for an hour and a quarter. Serve his pie on a dish. 538. Farced brisket of mutton, Robert-sauce. Open a brisket of mutton, at the side of the ribs, by slipping the blade of the knife between the bones and the meat; season it interiorly, fill it with a mince of fresh pork, mixed with a handful of grated bread- crumb, some chopped mushrooms, a little onion and parsley, likewise chopped. Season this stuffing properly. Sew up the aperture of the brisket, and let it boil in a good broth, like that of the stock-pot. When it is done, drain it, dish it, and mask it with a ‘Robert’ sauce (see art. 173).THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK 236 V 539. Broiled brisket of mutton, with sour-gravy. Let two briskets of mutton soak in cold water, drain them, trim them, remove the bone adhering to the sinews, as well as the remainder of the skin adhering to the extremities of the ribs ; tie the biiskets both together, place them thus in a stewpan with water, salt, and a tew vege- tables; boil them according to the same method as applied to the stock-pot soup ; when they are at the degree requisite, bone them, let them cooi between twro baking-sheets, in order to get them quite straight, as soon as they have cooled, trim them regularly, season them with salt and pepper, roll them in butter, sprinkle over a handful ot cooked fine-herbs and chopped parsley, roll them in bread-crumb, and let them broil lor twenty minutes on a slow fire, mind turning them; dish, and serve separately a good sour-gravy {see art. 171). 540. Roast leg of mutton with gravy. In order to get a roast leg of mutton, which may be eaten in good conditions, the meat must be furnished by a young, well-led animal; moreover it must be kept hanging to the degree requisite: as a leg of mutton, if too fresh, is not only tough, but also of mean succulence. Let the leg of mutton be roasted on the spit, or in the oven, the operation is always of the plainest kind, the main thing is not to do it too much, as then it would be dry ; nor yet to have it under-done, as meat with the blood in it, even in England, is less estimated than generally is supposed. For a leg of mutton of six or seven pounds, roasted on the spit or in the oven, fifty-five or sixty minutes will do, if the fire be well managed; if the fire is slow and but little blazing, it will require a quarter of an hour more. — In order to have the leg done to the degree requisite, the meat must remain rose-colored in the interior or at least round the inner bone ; but if this part is too highly attacked by the heat, the meat o course will be dry, and have lost a great part of its good qualities. Roast leg of mutton must be served with a little good gravy, an a garnish of vegetables or vegetable-puree; in any case, the gravy is served separately.237 MUTTON. - BRISKET, LEG, SADDLE. 541. Braised saddle of mutton. The piece of mutton called a ‘saddle, is that part of the back or ine, which from the extremity of the legs reaches to the first ribs, a more bulky piece is wanted, a part of the ribs is left adhering to 3 saddle. Draw. 176. Remove the kidneys from off the saddle, remove the skin covering ! fat of both the fillets; cut off the skirts or flaps (bavettes), and roll im up underneath ; truss the meat, in the manner represented by the awing; place it in a deep baking-sheet, or else in a braising-pan, the ttom of which is masked with trimmings of bacon, then with large ces of onion and carrot; salt it, moisten it with a pint of broth ; let ■ liquid reduce on a good fire. Moisten it then to half its height, let it lise on a slow fire. — When the saddle is nearly done, drain it; pass 5 cooking-stock through a sieve, lighten it with a little white wine or )th, skim off its fat, place it then back in the stewpan with the saddle; ish cooking the saddle at the entrance of the oven, moistening it leatedly with its own cooking-stock, so as to let it take a nice color, sh it then, and surround it with a garnish of vegetables, or else with )uree ; skim the fat off the cooking-stock, which pass through a sieve, :1 serve separately. 542. Sheep’s kidneys, farmer’s way. Divide seven or eight fresh kidneys, distributing each of them in ir parts, splitting them in the middle; put them into a little pan with tter, season them, let them fry on a brisk fire, tossing them till they238 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. have set, and their moisture is reduced ; drain them with the skimmer, place them in a small stewpan, and keep them warm. — On the other hand, mince a dozen or fifteen fresh mushrooms, put them into the pan, let them fry at a brisk fire, with butter and a clove of garlic; toss them, season them highly; when their moisture is reduced, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, and moisten them with a little good cream ; let the stew boil quickly for five or six minutes, range it in a circle on the bottom of a dish, and place the kidneys in the centre. 543. Stew of sheep’s liver and pluck (fraissure), with wine. Take a sheep’s liver and pluck; cut the latter in squares, and the liver in slices. Put the lights into a stewpan with a piece of butter, an onion, and a garnished bunch; season it, let it fry, stirring it; when it has taken a nice color, sprinkle over a pinch of flour; a few minutes after, moisten it to cover with either white or red wine ; let the liquid boil,'remove the stewpan back on a more moderate fire. ?On the other hand, place a dozen small onions m a stewpan, with • butter let them fry ; add a little salt, and a pinch of sugar ; when they have taken a nice color, drain the fat, moisten them with a little broth; boil the onions, letting the liquid reduce. — When the lights are nearly done, season the slices of liver, fry them slightly, and mix them into the stew, add also the onions. Let the stew simmer tor ten minutes ; then dish it, having removed the bunch. 544. Farced minion-fillets of mutton. Choose ten or twelve minion-fillets of mutton, remove their epi- dermis, beat them, trim them, give them the shape of a long square, season them ; chop the trimmings with a like quantity of bacon and raw ham ; mix into the hash a handful of bread-crumb, an egg, a spoonful o shalots, and mushrooms, a pinch of parsley, chopped; season it with salt and pepper; when well mixed, mask the fillets with it, one side o il , applying it in a thin layer; then roll the 'paupiettes, traverse them u a wooden skewer; roll them in melted butter, breadcrumb them and broil them at a slow fire for twelve or fifteen minutes, turning them,239 MUTTON. — KIDNEYS, LIVER. when done, glaze them with the paste-brush. Remove the skewers, dish the fillets on a puree of white haricot-beans. 545. Sheep’s kidneys broiled. In order to broil sheep’s kidneys, first must be removed the skin surrounding them; then cleave them through the middle, but without detaching the two parts, lay them open, beat them very slightly, then pierce them across the centre with a small, metal skewer, so as to keep them open. Put two kidneys on each skewer ; season them, and moisten them with Draw. 177. melted butter, let them broil on a good tire, turning them for seven or eight minutes. Broiled kidneys are usually served on a quite hot dish, with a piece of hotel-keeper’s-butter on each kidney. Hotel-keeper’s-butter is simply fresh butter mixed with parsley, lemon-juice, salt, and pepper. 546. Sheep’s kidneys, sautes. In order to get the tossed kidneys good, one must start from the principle, that they must be fried on a brisk fire, and never be allowed to boil in the sauce. — Mince seven or eight sheep’s kidneys, put them into a pan with a piece of butter, season them, fry them on a brisk fire, till they have well set, but yet are under-done, that is, the meat must have set, without being dry ; drain the kidneys, to collect the gravy; but this gravy being always of a disagreeable odor, and of bad taste, it is better thrown away. On the other hand, let fry in a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; when it has taken color, moisten it with a little thickened gravy or brown-sauce, as well as with a little white wine; let the sauce boil quickly, stirring it carefully ; four or five minutes after, it must be well thickened, and succulent: add to it the kidneys, and take it off the fire; season the stew, then finish it with the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of chopped onion.240 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Here is a more simple method: put into a small frying-pan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, and a piece ot butter; let it Iry on a moderate fire; add to it the minced kidneys; season them, let them fry on a brisk fire; when they have set, remove them with a skimmer, and put them into a plate ; mix a little wine to the liquid, let it reduce to halt; then add to it a few spoonfuls of good melted glaze; let the liquid boil, thicken it with a small piece of kneaded - butter; add to the sauce the kidneys, a small pepper, and a little chopped parsley; warm them without any ebullition, and serve. — To this stew may be always added some cut fresh mushrooms. 547. Sheep’s tongues, ‘a la soubise’. Blanch and braise, short of moisture, eight sheep’s tongues. Drain them, remove the skin, and trim them; place them in a saute-pan, with the cooking-stock, reduced to half-glaze, gently warm them at the entrance of the oven, and glaze them. — When about to serve, dish them in a circle, slightly mask them with their own stock, and fill the central hollow with a onion-puree (see art. 87). 548. Sheep’s tongues, with turnips. Soak in cold water eight fresh sheep’s tongues, drain, scald, and scrape them. Melt in a stewpan three ounces of chopped bacon, add to it the tongues ; season, and fry till of a nice color; sprinkle over a handful of flour, moisten with a sufficient quantity of white wine, and hot broth, to cover them ; then add a garnished bunch, and let it boil over a slow fire. A quarter of an hour after, add to it a garnish ot turnips ; whole, if they are small, but if large, in balls or quarters ; let them be previously blanched, color them in a frying-pan with lard, then season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, and continue boiling: tongues, and turnips, should be done at the same time. Dish up the tongues in a circle, and fill the centre with the garnish of turnips.241 MUTTON. - NECK; SHEEP’S-TONGUES. 549. Larded neck of mutton. Choose a large neck of mutton, remove then the chine-bone, cut the sides straight, and shorter than commonly is done, then trim close the meat of the fillets, removing the fat covering them, but without baring the ribs (see the drawing 178); lard this fillet with fine bacon, on all its length ; wrap the meat up in a sheet of oiled paper, fix it to the spit with the aid of a skewer, let it roast, basting it with butter; three quarters of an hour after, unwrap it, in order to give it a nice color; take it off the spit, salt it, dish it, and serve it with good gravy, and potato-puree. — In the same way may be served a neck of veal. Draw. 178. 550. Sheep’s tongues, with onions. Let braise ten fresh mutton-tongues, proceeding, as indicated in the art. 551 ; keep them warm. — On the other hand, mince five or six fine white onions, let them fry with butter to a nice color 5 add to them a little sugar ; sprinkle over a pinch of flour, moisten them with a little good warm milk 5 boil the stew for seven or eight minutes, stirring it; at last, thicken it with two yolks of eggs, diluted with cream ; at this degree, it should prove of a nice consistence, like that of a puree. Put the stew on the centre of a warm dish, and range the tongues all round. 551. Sheep’s-tongues, in ruffles. Blanch five or six fresh sheep’s tongues ; range them side by side in a flat stewpan, previously spread with some trimmings of ham, and with minced vegetables; then moisten them to cover with white wine and broth, let them braise on a very slow fire. An hour and a half after, drain the tongues, remove their skin; let them glaze, and finish cooking them; let them cool in their own cooking-stock, then split them by the middle on their side, in such a manner as to take the form of a heart. 16THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 242 Prepare some tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs (see art. 41), let them cool, add to them two spoonfuls of raw ham, cut in very fine dice, and the same of grated fresh bacon. Mask the tongues then with this preparation, applying it on both sides. — Cut half-sheets ol white and strong paper, fold them in two, round them with the scissors on their cut sides, oil them with the paste-brush; fold the tongues up in the paper without leaving any outlet, where the fat could escape; range these ruffles on a gridiron, let them warm on a very slow fire, for twenty minutes, without blackening the paper ; immediately dish them. 552. Boiled leg of mutton, caper-sauce. Get a good leg of mutton, kept hanging but a little while, and cut round, that is, without the loin adhering to it; saw the protruding bone and knuckle, plunge the leg into a long stewpan, or a braising-pan, with boiling water; add a handful of salt, cover the vessel, give the leg as many quarters of an hour for cooking as it weighs pounds ; but notice keeping the ebullition violent, as well as continued. — At serving- time drain the leg, dish it, and mask it with a caper-sauce. 553. Braised leg of mutton. Simply bone the leg on the side of the cushion ; season the meat, tie it with thread ; cut the bone short. Place the leg in a long stewpan, with either melted bacon, or hog’s lard; let it fry on a slow fire, turning it, so as to give a delicate color; remove it then with the aid of a fork, then mask the bottom of the stewpan with a layer of minced vegetables: onions and large carrots. Season the leg, and twenty minutes after, moisten it to half its height, with broth; place it on a slow fire; when the liquid is reduced, moisten again, but without excess, so that the meat boils short of moisture: last of all, when the meat is done, the coolung- stock must be reduced to half-glaze; then skim off its fat, add to it a little white wine, and thicken it with a little ‘roux’ or kneaded-butter, pour it into the stewpan. At serving-time, drain the leg, untruss it, place it on a dish ; baste it with the sauce, passing it through a sieve. Braised leg ol mutton243 MUTTON. - SADDLE; SHEEP’S BRAINS, EARS. may be served with a puree of chestnut, turnip, or white haricot-beans; but it is obvious, that it may be also accompanied by any other garnish applicable to butcher’s meat. 554. Mutton-saddle, roast in the oven. If no spit is at disposal, a saddle of mutton may be roasted in the oven. Cut off a small saddle of mutton, remove the skin covering the fat, remove also the kidneys ; roll it up, bind it with thread, put it into a baking-sheet masked with fat and some vegetables, pour on a little warm water; baste the meat with butter or fat, push it into a hot oven, let it roast for three quarters of an hour, basting it; when it is done, season, and dish it up ; surround it with a garnish of potatoes, cut into the shape of small balls, and fried with butter. Serve at the same time a sauce- boatful of good gravy. 555. Sheep’s brains, with curry-sauce. Choose five or six very fresh sheep’s brains, let them soak in cold water, boil them, in water, with salt, vinegar, and minced vegetables; drain them, serve them on a hot dish, and mask them with a curry-sauce {see art. 576). 556. Sheep’s ears, with devil-sauce. Singe carefully a dozen sheep’s ears, boil them in white broth, just as calf s head is done {see art. 576). At serving-time, drain them, notch their protruding tube, in order to round it; dish them, and mask them with devil-sauce {see art. 175).244 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 557. Sheep’s trotters, ‘poulette’-sauce. Singe a dozen sheep’s feet (or trotters), remove the shaggy part between the cleft (,mfourdmre) of the foot; refresh them, boil them simply in salted water for five hours; drain them, and remove their main bone; place them in a stewpan, moisten them just to height with poulette - sauce, proceeding as is said for calf’s feet; let the feet simmer in the sauce for twenty-five minutes. Skim the fat off the sauce, thicken it with some diluted yolks of eggs; finish it with the juice of a lemon, and a piece of butter. Dish the stew. — Sheep’s trotters may, just as well as calf’s feet, be served with ‘vinaigrette’, either broiled or fried. 558. Slieep’s-tails with olives. Remove the thin parts of eight or ten sheep’s-tails, previously blanched ; put them into a stewpan with butter, two small onions, and a piece of carrot; let the meat fry on a slow fire, tossing it, and seasoning It. when it is of a nice color, sprinkle over a handful of flour, moisten them to cover with warm broth, a little gravy, and a little white wane; let the liquid boil; ten minutes after, remove it to the side of the fire if the sauce be not of a fine color, add to it a little caramel. When the tails are done, drain the sauce in a stewpan, passing it through a sieve skim it carefully, add to it a quarter of a glassful of white wine, let it reduce, until it proves thickened to the degree requisite; then trim the tails, add them to the sauce; two minutes after, remove the stewpan off the fire, mix into the stew a garnish of large stoned olives, and dish it. 559. Broiled mutton-cutlets. Not every body knows the method of trimming cutlets well; and in order more exactly to demonstrate the process, two drawings are here added, the former (181) represents a cutlet in its natural condition, the other (182) a trimmed one. It is certain, that cutlets may be also sen in mod, without being in taste the worse for it; bone and fa do ,m impeach to qualities; but, it is evident, that in order to pre ent *£ of cutlets at a table, they should be not only of a nice shape, aMUTTON. - CUTLETS ; SHEEP’S FEET, AND TAILS 245 in a condition giving neither too much trouble, nor too much work, to the persons eating them. A well trimmed cutlet, if done to the degree requisite, must be agreeable to every body; in any case, it is urgent, that a cook should know the method of well trimming a cutlet. These Draw. 183. are the motives which induced me to give a minute description of this operation.TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKEIIY- BOOK. 246 Choose a line neck of mutton ; cut straight the side of the rib-bones, also cut off the chine-bone. Now take the neck from the side of the loin, and cut the cutlets slantwise; in this manner the meat of the fillet is larger, and more easily to be flattened. In order to get fine, large, and thick cutlets, there must not be cut more than four or five from one neck of mutton. When the cutlets are cut, slightly disengage the fillet from the chine- bone, in order to be able to shorten the nether part of the rib-bone; remove the sinewy skin of the fillet, then disengage the meat all round on the upper end of the bone; so as to remove them by sciaping this. Beat sufficiently with the cutlet-bat (see drawing 180) the meat of the fillets, as well as the fat of the cutlet, in order to give the latter the breadth requisite. Round the fillet with the knife, cut the fat in a pointed way, so as to give the cutlet a fine shape, like that of the draw- ing 182. Season the cutlets, roll them in melted butter or in oil, range them on a gridiron, let them broil at a good fire, either in their natural con- dition, or being breadcrumbed ; turn them, after the lapse of six minutes; five or six minutes after, dish them, remove them, and serve them either with a garnish of fried potatoes, or potato-puree, or else, with a garnish of french-beans, green-pease, or any other vegetable. On page 103, I have represented the drawing of a gridiron (grillade), that is, a machine for broiling, very much in use in I ranee, even in small kitchens; the broiling here is operated by the aid of coals or charcoal, if the machinery is established well, all the smoke escapes by the pipe, and the meat by this very fact leaves nothing to lie desired, in respect to its perfection. The drawing (183), given in this article (p. 245), represents the broiling of meat effected by the aid of mineral coal burning m the kitchen-stove; this method is highly ingenious, and if due care is taken, the meat must be good ; yet under such conditions, it is not always easy to avoid the smoke’s spreading in the kitchen, and from thence into the apartments, a fact not free from inconvenience.MUTTON. — TAILS, CUTLETS, MINCE. 247 560. Sheep’s-tails with haricot-puree. Blanch eight fine sheep’s-tails, refresh them, tie them together by two and two, range them in a stewpan, the bottom of which is masked Avith minced vegetables ; moisten them to cover with broth and white Avine; add to it a bunch of aromatics, peppercorns, and cloves; let the liquid boil. After the lapse of ten minutes, remove the stewpan to the side of the fire, or at the entrance of a slack oven ; braise the tails quite gently, basting them; when they are at the degree requisite, drain them, and dish them round a haricot-puree ; pass the cooking-stock, through a sieve, skim off its fat, let it reduce to half-glaze, pour it over the sheep’s-tails. 561. Welsli-mutton-cutlets, with macedoine. Take fifteen trimmed small cutlets of Welsh-mutton, season them, range them in a flat stewpan with melted butter, fry them, turning them; Avhen nearly done, drain off the fat of the steAvpan, moisten the cutlets Avith three tablespoonfuls of good gravy, let the liquid quickly reduce to glaze. Dish the cutlets in a circle, and fill the hollow Avith a ‘macedoine’ of vegetables (see art. 77). 562. Minced mutton, garnished. Carefully trim the meat of a boiled leg, or braised saddle, of mut- ton ; chop it, but not too fine; put the mince into a stewpan, keep it covered. — Fry with butter, in a steAvpan, two or three tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; sprinkle over a pinch of flour, which fry for two minutes, stirring it Avith a spoon ; then moisten it with a little gravy, so as to obtain a sauce, which is not too clear; add to it a bunch of aromatics; boil the sauce for a few minutes, carefully stirring it; Avhen it is relish- ing, remove the bunch, and add the mutton-mince; mix the sauce and meat Avell, without allowing the former to boil: the sauce must not be too abundant; season then the hash with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; sur- round it either Avith bread-crusts fried Avith butter, or else with poached eggs.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-LOOK. 248 563. Mutton-mince, ‘a la menagere’. Cut into small slices a piece of roast or braised leg, remove its hard parts, and place the slices in a flat stewpan. — Pour a quarter of a glass of vinegar into a small stewpan, add to it some peppercorns, cloves, and a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics; let it boil, reduce it one third; add to it a gill of good gravy; after the lapse of two minutes, thicken the liquid with a piece of kneaded-butter; pass the sauce through a sieve over the slices of mutton, warm them quite gently; if the meat has been roasted, it must be carefully observed, not to boil the sauce, lest the meat should get tough ; then dish the stew. 564. Mutton-stew, with vegetables. In order to prepare good mutton-stew, there is requisite good fresh meat taken off both ends of the breast, that is, from the neck, and the side of the loin ; but a good stew can also be obtained with a brisket, and a shoulder, if the thin parts, as well as the most bony ones, have been removed. Mutton-stew is not a highly distinguished dish, but as a luncheon- dish appreciated by every body; it is of no difficult preparation, yet requires the most attentive carefulness, without which all kitchen-opera- tions are far from complete. Cut, in middling-sized squares, two pounds of meat, put it into a stewpan, with either hog’s lard or chopped bacon, rather than with buttei, which is more apt to burn ; add to it a pinch of sugar ; set the stewpan on a good fire, stir the meat continually with a spoon ; when it is well fried, season it, and sprinkle over two ounces of flour ; let the flour try tor a few minutes, but stirring the meat, without leaving off, then drain its fat from the stewpan, and moisten the meat, a little more than to height, but by degrees only, with warm broth, or simply with water, diluting care- fully the fried flour. Stir the stew till the sauce starts to ebullition; it must be slightly thickened. If the meat has been moistened with water, a little salt must be added ; a garnished bunch is requisite in every case. Cover the stewpan, remove it back on a more moderate flic, boil the stcv foi an hour and a half; then mix into it a vegetable-garnish, composed of249 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON-CUTLETS, IRISH STEW. carrots, turnips, ancl small onions : the most tender vegetables are put in last of all; the onions must be blanched, the carrots and turnips are cut in middling-sized quarters. Season these vegetables with salt and pepper; add to it a little broth, if the sauce were short; push now the stcwpan to the entrance of a slack oven ; moisten the vegetables, from time to time, with the sauce. This is the true theory of mutton - stew: it certainly may be sim- plified, but whoever makes it a point to prepare it well, will never dare to fail in carefulness. — The garnish, of course, may be modified; instead of intermingled vegetables it may be composed of but one species of vegetables : carrots, turnips, or potatoes. 565. Breadcrumbed cutlets of mutton, with green-pease. Trim a dozen cutlets, season, dip them in melted butter, and bread- crumb them ; let them broil at a moderate fire ; put a ruffle on their bones, Draw. 184.] dish them up in a circle, garnish the centre with fresh or preserved green-pease. Breadcrumbed mutton-cutlets, may be served with fried potatoes, or with potato-puree, a ‘macedoine’ of vegetables, or else with a puree of celery, or potatoes. 566. Irish stew. Cut short the ribs of a neck of mutton, remove the back-bone, then divide the meat transversally ; range them in layers in a stcwpan, spread-THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-HOOK. 250 ing over eacli of these layers some thin slices ot minced onion; season each layer with salt and pepper; the latter of which must predominate a little. Moisten the meat just to height with water, add to it a bay-leaf. Let the liquid boil, cover the stewpan, remove it back to the side of the tire, let the stew simmer till the meat be three-parts done; then mix up with it a garnish of raw potatoes, cut to the shape of large olives, season them with salt and pepper, continue gently boiling the stew ; the meat and potatoes should prove done at the same time; the liquid then must be reduced to half, and be slightly thickened. Dish the meat with the vegetables all round. 567. Mutton-hash, with onions. Mince four large white onions, put them into a flat stewpan, with a piece of butter; let them fry gently, stirring them with a spoon; then season them with salt and pepper; when they have taken a nice color, sprinkle over a little flour, moisten them with a glassful of white wine, and with a little gravy ; let the liquid boil, remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire. Cut, in small slices, the meat of a boiled and cooled leg of mutton, range these slices in the stewpan holding the onions : warm them without ebullition, if the meat has been roasted. Season, and add to it a little chopped parsley; dish the meat, and pour over it the sauce and onions. 568. Mutton-hash, with soft-boiled eggs. Take a pound, or a pound and a quarter, of meat from a cooked leg or loin of mutton, trim it neatly, cut it in small dice, which place in a stewpan ; cut also in dice ten cooked mushrooms, add them to the meat; season the ‘salpicon, and cover the stewpan, keeping it on the side of the fire. Chop two or three shalots, put them into a small stewpan with half a glass of madeira-wine, a bunch of parsley, with aromatics, and a few peppercorns ; cover the stewpan, reduce the liquid to half, mix it with double its volume of brown-sauce; which reduce till well thickened, finish it with a little melted glaze, and pass it through a sieve, over the minced meat; warm the hash without ebullition, then dish it up; suiMUTTON-HASH. - CALF’S HEAD. 251 round it with seven or eight poached egg's ; place between each egg a bread-crust, cut in the shape of a crescent, and fried with butter. 569. Calf’s head, madeira-sauce. In order to serve a whole calf’s head, such as represented by the drawing, there are but two methods of proceeding: that is, either to bone the head and farce it, or else to boil it whole, without being boned; the latter method is rather preferable. To farce a calf’s head, for the sole Draw. 185. purpose of boiling it whole, is truly not worth the while; this mode of preparation being expensive, and taking much time; boiling it with its bones is better. To this end, the head first of all must be well soaked; when singed, disengage the tongue, and cleanse the interior parts with the utmost care; then disengage the extremity of the jaws, both upper and nether, in order to shorten it: as by this proceeding the muzzle keeps better in shape. In order to prevent the irregular tearing of the skin on the forehead, it is necessary to effect a small incision on that part, just bet veen the two ears. Fill the cavities of both the calf’s-ears with a large piece of carrot, wrap them up separately in a small cloth, so that they may not break. Rub the calf’s head then all over its suface with half a lemon, and also wrap it up carefully in a wet cloth, whereupon tie it with thread,252 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. put it into a braising-pan, with cold water, a few vegetables, salt, spices, and a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, and then a pinch of flour diluted with cold water. Boil the head on a very slow tire: a calf s-head will take three or four hours for its boiling, seldom less. But for greater security, it is convenient to probe it from time to time. At serving-time, drain the calf’s head, unwrap it, set it on a long dish. Hide the opening of the skin on the skull, either with a layer of force-meat, or with a fliatelet’- skewer garnished with a fine cock’s-comb, a truffle or mushroom, besides a large poached quenelle. Surround the head with a garnish composed of button-mushrooms, yolks of eggs boiled hard, quenelles, cocks’-combs, and truffles ; the cocks’-combs indeed, as well as the truffles, may be dispensed with; they may be replaced by little balls of brains and gerkins. Mask these garnishes with a little madeira-sauce {see art. 183), the remainder of which serve in a sauce- boat. 570. Mutton-hash, with rice. Prepare a mutton-hash, in the conditions prescribed in the preceding art. 568; when it is thickened, keep it in the ‘bain-marie’. — On the other hand, wash a pound of rice, let it drain on a sieve, a quarter of an hour previous to using it. With this rice then prepare a good risotto; when it is nearly dry, remove it back to the side of the lire; five minutes after, introduce into it four tablespoonfuls of tomata - sauce, and a piece of butter kneaded with two spoonfuls of curry-powder; pour then half this rice into a deep dish, form a hollow in its centre, dish the hashed mutton into this cavity, and cover it up with the remainder of the rice; now smoothe the surface, sprinkle over a handful ot Par- mesan, moisten it with a little glaze, and serve it. 571. Mutton-pilaff. Disengage the bones, and big fillet of a neck of mutton (two pounds), remove its sinewy parts, cut them transvcrsally in pieces ot equal length and width, put them into a stewpan with a chopped onion, and some253 MUTTON-PILAFF. — CALF’S HEAD. butter; season, and let them fry for a quarter of an hour ; then moisten them with a glassful of mutton-broth; prepared with the trimmings ; let the liquid boil quite gently, until it be reduced to glaze ; replenish the liquid, until the meat be nearly done; then moisten with three pints of broth, add to it a bunch of parsley, and aromatics; after five minutes’ ebullition, mix into the liquid a pound of picked and washed rice ; five minutes after, cover the stewpan, remove it to a slow fire. Twenty minutes after, the rice should be found done, and dry; dish, and serve the pilaff. 572. Calf’s head, with turtle-garnish. Take half a large calf’s head, blanched and boned; when it is ■singed, remove its ear, rounding the root, then cut up the remainder into Draw. 18G. pieces of an oblong shape ; boil them together with the ear, proceeding as is indicated in the art. 5G9. At serving-time, drain them. — Prepare some turtle-garnish, composed of small quenelles, truffles, mushrooms, cocks’-combs, and yolks of eggs boiled hard: the cocks’-combs are not of strict necessity. — Fix a support in fried bread on the centre of a dish ; on the top of this support set the calf’s ear, having notched its254 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. tube; surround it with a small portion of the garnish; and dish the pieces of the head round the latter; range then the remainder of the garnish round the pieces of the calf’s head, then mask the one as well as the other, with some good brown-sauce, reduced with madeira-wine, and finished with a pinch of cayenne-pepper. — The dish, wherein the calf s head is served, is represented set upon a hot-water dish. 573. Calf’s head, Bearn-sauce. Divide in pieces half a blanched and singed calf’s-liead; let them boil, proceeding, as indicated art. 576. — At serving-time, drain the pieces of head, notch the external tube of the ear, which set in an upright position on a dish ; surround it now with the other pieces, mask all with a white or brown Bearn-sauce (see art. 168). The Bearn-sauce may be replaced by piquant-sauce. 574. Calf’s head in marinade. Take the quarter of a boiled calf’s head (see art. 576), divide it into pieces of oblong shape, and let them half-cool; then remove their meat, and place them in a kitchen-basin ; season with salt, pepper, oil, and lemon-juice ; sprinkle over a pinch of chopped parsley, toss them in this seasoning, and before the meat is too cold, take the pieces up, one by one, dip them into frying-paste (see art. 59), and plunge them into hot frying-fat; as soon as the paste has taken a fine color, drain the pieces of head, dish them on a napkin, with fried parsley all round; serve separately some tomata-sauce {see art. 195). 575. Cold veal-pie. Take four pounds of cushion of veal, remove its sinewy skin; cut half of this meat into large squares, choosing the most delicate pieces; chop the rest, mix it with a little more than its weight of fresh bacon; highly season the hash, take it out, and put it into a kitchen-basin; add to it four tablespoonfuls of cooked lean ham, chopped very fine. Lard the large squares of veal (piercing them through and through) with fillets of raw ham, intermingled with bacon, and seasoned with255 VEAL. - PIE, COLD AND HOT. spices; place these squares in a stewpan, add to them four ounces of chopped and melted bacon, let them fry for some minutes on a good fire; season, and moisten them with a quarter of a glass of white wine; as soon as the wine has reduced, turn the meat out into a basin, and let it cool; then add to it half a pound of boiled bacon, cut in large dice. Butter a cold pie-mould of oblong form ; line it with short- paste for pies (see art. 55, 57); mask the paste on the bottom, and all round, with a layer of the pre- viously prepared hash; raise the preparation to a dome, set a bay- leaf on its top. Cover this dome with a thin flat of short-paste, then with another flat of puff - paste: make a chimney in the centre of the dome. Egg the puff-paste, and notch it. Pinch the edges of the pie, bake it in a slack oven for two hours at least, covering it with paper ; half an hour after, when it is taken out of the oven, filter into it through its top two glassfuls of aspic-jelly. Keep the pie in a cold place, serve it twenty-four hours after. 576. Calf’s head with curry. Take half a calf’s head, blanch it, singe it, then distribute it in rounds or squares, but leaving the ear whole; put these pieces into a stewpan, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, moisten them to cover with cold water; add to them one onion, peppercorns and cloves, salt, and half a glassful of white wine. Let the pieces of calf’s head boil on a slow fire, and kept covered. Mince two onions, fry them with butter, to a nice golden color; sprinkle over three tablespoonfuls of curry-powder, and one of flour ; fry the flour for a few moments, moisten it with a third part of the cooking- stock of the calf’s head, and two thirds of broth; stir the sauce until starting to ebullition; add to it some slices of raw ham, one bay-leaf, and a bunch of parsley; after the lapse of a few minutes, add the piecesTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKEllY-BOOIv. 25G of calf’s head, well drained ; the sauce must cover them. Now remove the stewpan hack to the side of the tire ; a quarter ot an hour after, skim the fat off the sauce, which thicken with a few yolks of eggs. Take up the pieces of calf’s head with a fork, drain, and dish them, placing the ear in the middle. Mix into the sauce the juice of a lemon, pour it on a dish, passing it through a sieve. 577. Hot veal-pie. Take a piece of loin of veal, remove all its hones and hard parts, then cut the meat transversally into thin slices; season them with salt and pepper, range them on a pie-dish, alternating them with thin slices of raw ham or streaky bacon. Pour, on the bottom of the dish, a gill of good gravy, mixed with a little ketchup ; finish the pie proceeding as said, art. 537. 578. Roast round of veal. Cut a fine slice (rowMle) of veal, out of the largest diameter of a leg, five inches thick ; remove the centre-hone, which replace by a bread- stuffing ; support the meat by means of two iron-skewers, disposed through the meat, neatly wrap it up in buttered coarse paper, and put it on the cradle-spit; let it roast at a moderate fire, basting repeatedly. Half an hour previous to taking the fillet of veal off the spit, unwiap it, so as to let it take a nice color ; then salt it, take it off the spit, and place it on a baking-sheet; remove the thread, replace the iron-skewers by silver ones ; serve the meat with a few spoonfuls of clear good gravy; o-laze all the surfaces of the piece, and serve separately a dish of vege- tables, boiled in salted water or in steam; these vegetables being such as : carrots, cauliflowers, turnips, french-beans, and green-pease. 579. Leg of veal, with cream. Saw off the bone from the cushion of a small leg of veal, of fine white meat; shorten the bone, place the leg on a roasting-pan, baste it with butter; roast it in a slack oven, basting, and turning it repeatedly; when it is nearly done, salt it, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, and pomBUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL-CUSHION, BLANQUETTE. 257 on the baking-sheet a glassful of raw cream ; finish roasting the meat always on a slow lire, basting it from time to time. As soon as the leg is done, drain, and dish it; put a ruffle to the bone ; pour the sauce into a stewpan, passing it through a sieve ; mix into it a little melted glaze, let it reduce, finish it with a drop of vinegar, pour it on the meat. 580. Cushion of veal, larded and braised. Trim a cushion of veal, letting the udder adhere to it; lard it on its side with fine bacon, place it in a long and square stewpan, the bottom Draw. 188. of which is masked with trimmings of bacon, and minced vegetables; slightly salt the meat, and braise it (see art. 583), basting it repeatedly with its stock : when the meat is at the degree requisite, it ought to prove of a fine color, and well saturated with its own cooking-stock. At serving-time, drain the meat on a dish, surround it with a garnish of round ‘croquettes’: lighten its cooking-stock, let it boil, pass it through a sieve, and skim off its fat; then thicken it with a little sauce, or serve it, as it is, in a sauceboat. A cushion of veal, prepared thus, may be served either with a good tomata-sauce, or with a garnish of green-pease, cucumbers, savoy-cab- bage ; or else with a soubise-puree. 581. Veal blanquette. Cut into squares half a brisket of veal, let these squares soak for an hour; drain them, put them into a stewpan, moisten them to cover with a glassful of white wine and water ; add a little salt, let the liquid boil, skimming it. A few minutes after, pour the liquid, as well as 17258 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. the meat, on to a colander, placed over a kitchen-basin, so as to gather, and preserve the moisture. Refresh the squares of veal, trim them of the superfluous bones. Chop an onion, let it fry with butter, without allowing it to take color ; add to it the squares of veal, fry them on a good fire for a few minutes ; slightly season them, sprinkle over a small handful of flour, moisten them (notice doing so off the fire and only gradually) with the cooking-stock preserved for that purpose; place the stewpan back on the fire, stir the liquid until starting to ebullition : the sauce then must be thickened; give it a few bubblings, add a bunch of parsley, a bay-leaf, some mushroom-trimmings, peppercorns, and cloves; remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire, cover it, and keep it thus, until the meat be done. Then remove the pieces of meat with a fork, range them in a smaller stewpan; skim the fat off* the sauce, pass the latter through a sieve, let it reduce for a few minutes on a brisk fire ; when it is done, thicken it with three diluted yolks of eggs, finish it with a little nutmeg, pour it on the meat, straining it. Add a pinch of chopped pars- '■ ley, the juice of a lemon, and dish it. 582. Loin of veal, with cream. Entirely bone a loin of veal, keeping the flap short; trim it, truss it, then let it roast with butter, in the oven, but notice basting it repeatedly. As soon as the loin is done, drain it, trim it square, cut it in thin slices; then bring it back into shape, on a remove-dish, alternating each slice with a spoonful of minced truffles. The loin being brought back into form, mask it with a layer of very consistent reduced bechamel-sauce, mixed with a well-whipped white of egg, so as to render it still mou consistent; sprinkle over this layer a little grated parmesan, pour over a little melted butter, then glaze it by aid of the salamader. Surround the meat, on both sides, with ‘croquettes’, and serve separately a boatful of half-glaze. 583. Glazed cushion of veal, with chicory. Trim a cushion of veal without removing the udder; stud the meat on the sides, and above, with alternate fillets of raw ham and bacon.259 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — VEAL-LOIN, AND SADDLE. Season the meat, put it into a square stewpan with six ounces of chopped bacon, fry it on a slow fire, turning it several times ; as soon as it has taken a fine color, mix into it some raw small onions, and a cut large carrot; continue frying the meat for a quarter of an hour; moisten it with two gills of broth, add to it a few fresh pieces of swartli; cover the stew- pan, remove it back on a very slow fire, or in order to braise the meat short of moisture, lightening the liquid now and then. When the meat is done, drain, and dish it on a chicory - garnish, finished with a part of the gravy from the veal; serve separately the remainder of the gravy. 584. Loin, and saddle, of veal. The ‘saddle’ of veal is that part of the animal, which parting off the breast goes to the point of junction with the legs. The piece called loin is half of the saddle cut lengthwise. In those countries, where calves are of superior qualities, large and tat, a loin (that is, half a saddle) of veal constitutes a copious remove; but in countries, where calves are small, and ill-fattened, it is nearly impossible to serve only one loin at a dinner of numerous guests ; in this case, the saddle must be used. A fine, white and fat loin of veal can be only served roasted, either in the oven, or on the spit. In order to obtain a fine loin, it must be cut so, that two bones of the neck are left adhering, then the bone of the chain is cut, the flat bones of the large fillet are disengaged, and the skirt is cut short; diminish the thickness of the fat, shutting up the kidney ; roll the skirt up, bind the meat with thread. Wrap the loin up in a greased paper, roast it at a good fire, for one hour at least, basting it with butter. Unwrap the meat, a quarter of an hour previous to takingTI-IE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 260 it off the lire ; salt it at the last moment, and dish it.

Stewed brisket of veal, with turnips. Cut into middling-sized squares, half of a fine brisket of veal. — Melt in a stewpan four tablespoonfuls of butter, mix into it three spoon- fuls of flour; which fry for a few moments, stirring it; add then to it the pieces of veal, let them fry without ceasing to stir it, until the meat has well set. At this degree, take the stewpan off the fire, drain the fat, moisten the meat, gradually, and just to cover, with broth and white wine ; season, add a pinch of pepper, a garnished bunch, and a large onion studded with cloves; stir the stew on the fire, until starting to ebullition, then remove it back. Prepare a garnish of good turnips, cut in balls, with the aid ot a vegetable-spoon, or else cut to the shape of a clove of garlic; blanch them for a few minutes, drain them well, put them into a frying pan with butter, let them take color on a good fire ; season them, and add a pinch of sugar ; drain their fat, and mix them into the stew : the latter should at this moment be half-done; continue the moderate ebullition. When the meat and vegetables are done, skim off the fat from the sauce, and dish the stew. 586. ‘Timbale’ of veal-sweetbreads. Prepare a pound and a quarter of veal-force-meat; try a little part of it previous to employing it, and rectify it, it necessary. — Butter a dome-mould, decorate it with rounds of truffle, line it with a layer of the force-meat, of the thickness of an inch. — Blanch three sweetbreads, cut them up in slices.

Divide a brisket of veal into fine middling-sized squares; let these squares soak for full an hour; put them into a stewpan, moisten themTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 2G2 to cover with broth and wine ; let the liquid boil. Then drain the meat, refresh, and trim it. — Cut in dice two large onions, slightly try them with butter ; add to them the meat, and now let them fry together, till they have taken a yellow shade ; season them, sprinkle over two table- spoonfuls of flour, and the same of curry - powder ; three minutes alter, moisten them, just to cover, with the cooking-stock 5 stir the liquid until starting to ebullition, which keep up for ten minutes; remove the stewpan back to a more moderate lire, add to it a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics, one carrot, six ounces of raw ham cut in dice, two small onions, and some mushroom-trimmings. When the meat is done, drain it, trim it, and range it into a smaller stewpan; let the sauce reduce quickly to the degree requisite; thicken it then with a few yolks of eggs, diluted with cream, immediately pour it on the meat. Dish the stew, accompany it with a dish of rice boiled in water. 589. Montglas of veal, with crusts. Take a cooked minion-fillet of veal, trim away the sinewy parts, and divide it in slices, an eighth of an inch thick, and an inch wide; cut these slices transversally, thus obtaining some small square fillets; which put into a stewpan, add half their volume of cooked pickled ox-tongue, and mushrooms cut in fillets. Pour into a flat stewpan, two gills of brown-sauce, work it, intro- ducing into it a few tablespoonfuls of madeira, mix the hnontglas’ with it, warm it without ebullition ; season with a little cayenne-pepper, dish up, and surround it with fried bread-crusts glazed with the paste- brush. 590. Larded veal-sweetbreads, with sorrel. The model is given here of a larded veal-sweetbread. — Previous to larding the veal-sweetbreads, they must be blanched without excess: then refresh them, and let them cool with a light weight on; they can only be larded, when perfectly cold. Trim four veal-sweetbreads of their sinewy skin, lard them on the smoother side with four rows of bacon-fillets. — Mask the bottom of aBUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL-MOATGLAS, ERICA A DEAL’. 263 Draw. 193. stewpan with minced onions and carrots, add to this a bunch of aromatics, and spices ; place the veal-sweetbreads on this layer, slightly salt them, moisten them, just to height, with broth, of which the fat is not removed; set the stewpan on a quick tire, let the liquid reduce to half; cover the sweetbreads with a greased paper, shut the stewpan, remove it back to a moderate tire. When the veal-sweetbreads are nearly done, drain their cooking-stock, passing it through a sieve ; skim off its fat, mix into it a little Avine, pour it on the sweet- breads ; set the stewpan on a good tire, let the liquid reduce to half-glaze; with this, glaze the sweetbreads, keep them then for a few minutes at the entrance of the oven; when they are of a nice color, dish them, one beside the other, on a garnish of sorrel; pour over their stock. 591. Fricandeau of veal, glazed. What is called a fricandeau, is simply a cushion of veal, trimmed , chopped down the middle, without entirely separating the two parts, then beaten Hat with the chopper, and larded on one surface in the style represented by the drawing 194. The cooking of a fricandeau is the same is that of a cushion of veal braised; it must be cooked short of moisture ; when it is thoroughly done, the meat should be glazed to a nice color on the larded side ; and the cooking-stock succulent. A ‘fricandeau’ glazed, may be served either with a tomata-sauce or a chestnut-puree, with sorrel or with spinach ; the gravy must be rid of its fat, passed and served separately. 592. Farced brisket of veal, tomata-sauce. Introduce the blade of a knife between the ribs and meat of a brisket of veal, in order to separate them ; thus form a sort of large bag, the bottom and end of it remaining joined, season its interior.2G4 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Chop separately three quarters of a pound of fresh bacon, and a pound of lean veal or pork ; mix up this meat, add to it a third of its volume of softened bread-crumb well pressed out; season the mince with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; chop it for some minutes more, then introduce into it three raw yolks of eggs, two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, and the same of equally chopped parsley. Slip this preparation into the hollow of the brisket, sew the meat all round, so as to leave no aperture; wrap it up in a tine cloth, bind it with thread on both sides, as well as in the middle, plunge it into a stock-pot, with water or broth in ebullition; if water, some salt and vegetables must be added to it, as for a soup. — The cooking-time of a brisket depends on its size : it will require two or three hours; when taken out of the stock-pot, drain it, unwrap it, untruss it, remove the bones of both the extremities, dish it, and mask the bottom of the dish with tomata-sauce (see art. 195). 593. Veal roasted in the stewpan. A slice of veal cut from the leg, a quasi {jump-loin), a cushion of veal, can successfully be roasted in the stewpan; if the operation is carried on carefully, which is besides of striking simplicity. The meat must first be trimmed, seasoned, tied with thread ; put it then into a stewpan proportionate to its volume, with butter and a piece of fresh bacon, cut in small dice; set the stewpan on a slow tire, let the meat fry, turning it frequently ; as soon as it has well set, cover the stewpan, put some tire on its lid, and thus finish roasting it without violence, turning it from time to time; when done, take it off the file, and dish it; pour a little gravy into the stewpan, let the liquid boil for a few moments, pour it on the meat, passing it through a sieve. 594. Veal-sweetbread, with macaroni. Choose two fine veal-sweetbreads, lard the finest with bacon, braise them both to a fine color, without doing them too much. — Boil a quarter of a pound of large macaroni, drain them, place them on a cloth, trans- versally cut them to the thickness of a fifth of an inch ; then range the rings against the sides of a buttered plain border-mould, applying the cut side against the mould ; interiorly support them with raw quenelle265 BUTCHER’S MEAT. - VEAL-SWEETBREADS, BOUDINS.

Veal-boudins, with mushroom. Trim twelve ounces of lean veal, cut it into small pieces, and pound it, until it be converted into paste; add to it six ounces of panada (see art. 110), pounding continually; at last add to it live ounces of butter; when the mixture is operated, season the force-meat with salt and nutmeg, add to it two yolks of eggs, one after the other, again pound it for live or six minutes, take it out, pass it through a sieve, and put it into a kitchen-basin. Half an hour after, mix into the force-meat a third its volume of cooked mushrooms, cut in dice; then take it up in equal parts with a266 TIJE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK tablespoon, let these parts be of the size of an egg ; drop these pieces on the floured table, roll them with the hand, giving them a long shape; flatten them with the blade of the knife, so as to give them an oblong- shape (see the draw. 196); dip them into beaten eggs, breadcrumb them, and fry them in a flat stewpan with butter; when done, drain, and dish them in a circle; All the centre with a garnish of minced mushrooms. 596. Aspic of veal-sweetbreads. Boil two or three sweetbreads, keeping them of a nice white, and not over-done ; let them cool in their own cooking-stock; then cut them into slices on their thick side; correctly trim these slices, place them on a dish, add to them some truffle-slices, and the same of rounds of pickled tongue. — Place a cylinder-mould in a basin with pounded ice all round and inside the cylinder; at the bottom of the mould let set a layer of aspic- jelly, then symmetrically dish a part of the slices of sweetbread, alternated by rounds of truffles, and rounds of pickled tongue, cover them with a layer of aspic-jelly, which let set, and then recommence the operation. When the mould is full, cover it with a plate; place on this plate some pounded ice, let the aspic-jelly set for full an hour. At serving-time, dip the mould quickly into warm water, immediately take it out again, wipe it, and turn the aspic-jelly out on a cold dish. 597. Glazed veal-scollops. Trim two line minion-fillets of veal, remove their sinewy skin; transversally divide the meat in slices ot the thickness ot a third of an inch ; beat them with the handle ot a knite, in order to get them thin; season, and fry them in a large and thin stewpan, with butter; when done, drain their butter, moisten them with two or three tablespoontuls of good gravy ; let the gravy reduce to glaze, then baste them with wine and a little tomata-sauce; let the liquid boil, and take it off the the. On the other hand, prepare a risotto with twelve ounces ot rice; finish it with butter and parmesan, mind keeping it rather consistent. At serving-time, pour the rice into a buttered border-mould , three minutes after, turn the rice out on a dish, and dish the scollops in the eentie, pour over the sauce.Draw. 197.

Take two large minion -fillets of veal , or a cushion of veal; divide them in slices of a length of four inches by two, slightly beat them with the flat side of the chopper, trim them regularly, season, and mask them with a layer of cooked tine-herbs, thickened with a little bread-crumb. Roll then each of the fillets up into the shape of small barrels, tie them with thread (see draw. 198); range them in a flat stewpan, with butter; fry them, turning them, and moisten them with a little broth, which let reduce to glaze; again moisten them with a little white wine and broth, braise them on a very slow lire, short of moisture; unwrap, and dish them on a garnish of risotto. Mix into the cooking-stock a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, let it boil, pass it through a sieve, serve it then in a sauceboat. 599. ‘Vol-au-vent’ of sweetbreads.

Cut in slices two blanched sweetbreads ; fry them in a stewpan with butter. — With the aid of two small spoons form some veal 'quenelles’, let them poach, drain them, place them beside the slices of sweetbread ; add some cooked mushrooms, either whole, or minced. Moisten these garnishes with a white or brown-sauce, keep them warm, without ebullition, till serving-time. Dish then the 'vol-au-vent’, fill it with garnishes, intermingling them, and pouring over them the sauce; cover the 'vol-au-vent’, and serve it. 600. Boiled calf’s pluck. Choose a fresh calf’s pluck of a fine white color; let it soak in water for a few hours, put it into a stewpan with water, and a drop of vinegar; let the liquid boil, and drain the pluck ; refresh it, scrape carefully all its folds, wash it, replace it into the same stewpan, with an onion studded with cloves, the pulp of two lemons freed of peel and piths, a bunch of aromatics, a little salt, half a pound of chopped beeCsuet, and at last a tablespoonful of flour, diluted with cold water ; set the stewpan on the fire ; at the first bubbling, remove it to the side ; boil the pluck for two hours and a half, keeping it rather firm; drain it then on a sieve, sptmge it on a cloth, dish it, and serve it with brown-butter, with a 'vinaigrette’, or with a white-sauce, finished with a little^vinegar, chopped leaves of taragon and pimpernel. 601. Stewed calf’s lights and liver. Let the half of a calf’s lights boil in salted water; drain it, spunge it, cut it into little slices.

Broiled veal-cutlets, tomata-sauce. In the article, mutton-cutlets, has been prescribed the practical way of proceeding for trimming the cutlets ; this method is applied to all Draw. 200, Draw. 201. cutlets of large sorts of meat. It cannot be highly enough recommended to all cooks, to apply themselves carefully to give the cutlet a line shape. If the ribs are taken off a line calf, the cutlets may not be cut slantways, lest they might get too bulky, they must be cut straight; and it must not be forgotten, that those, taken out of the covered side of the ribs, being the most delicate ones, of course are to be chosen in pre- ference. The two drawings given here can give a very exact idea, if not of the operation, at least of the difference there is, between a trimmed cutlet (200) and (201) one which is not. Cut six or seven veal-cutlets, beat them, without excess, with the flat side of a chopper; carefully trim them, season, and range them on a well cleansed gridiron, placing them side by side ; broil them at a moderate tire for fifteen or sixteen minutes, notice turning them, andTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 270 to baste them with butter; as soon as they are clone, dish them in a circle, glaze them with the aid of the paste-brush ; serve separately a good tomata-sauce {see art. 195). 603. Veal-cutlets, with mushrooms. Cut seven or eight veal-cutlets, not too large; trim them, season, and fry them in a flat stewpan, with butter, at a brisk fire ; six minutes after, turn them; when they have well set, remove them; drain the butter off the stewpan, into which then pour a glassful of brown-sauce, and a few tablespoonfuls of madeira ; let this sauce boil, stirring it; add to it two dozen fresh mushrooms, cut transversally ; boil them for seven or eight minutes ; as soon as the sauce has reduced to the degree requisite, and tastes well, put the cutlets back into the stewpan, heat them without ebullition, dish them in a circle; garnish the centre with the mushrooms, pour over the sauce. 604. Veal-cutlets, with fine-herbs. Chop a large onion and some shalots; put them into a stewpan with butter, let them fry without giving them color; add to them five or six tablespoonfuls of chopped raw mushrooms ; as soon as the latter have reduced their moisture, moisten them with a glassful of white wine and double that of broth ; let the liquid boil; slightly thicken it with a little sauce, and remove the stewpan to the side of the fire. On the other hand, trim seven or eight veal-cutlets, season, range them side by side in a stewpan with butter, let them fry and take a fine color on both sides; as soon as they have well set, drain off their fat, and mix into them the fine-herbs previously prepared; add a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics; let the sauce boil, then i erne's e it back to a slow fire; finish boiling the cutlets thus, turning them ; then dish them. — Lighten now the sauce with a little gravy, add to it some spoonfuls of raw truffles, the same of cooked lean ham, both of which cut into small dice ; after the lapse of a few minutes, remove the bunch, add a pinch of chopped parsley, and another of pepper; turn all out over the cutlets.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL-OUTLETS. 271 Draw. 203. stewpan, moisten them with their own cooking-stock, Draw. 202. 605.

At serving-time, dish the cutlets in a circle. Garnish the centre with a mushroom-puree (see art. 84), mask the bottom of the dish with a little white-sauce, reduced with some mushroom-trimmings, and the cooking-stock of the cutlets, passed through a sieve, and its fat skimmed off. 606. Studded veal-cutlets, ‘a la financier e’. Cut, off a fine neck of veal, a few cutlets; cut off the bone of the chine (chaine), shorten that of the rib ; very slightly beat the meat of the fillet, then stud it in a rosette, with square truffle-fillets : all the cutlets must be studded on the same side. Season the cutlets, range them side by side, on the bottom of a flat stewpan, masked with some minced vegetables, and braise them short of moisture, as directed, art. 605, basting them repeatedly ; take them off the fire, let them nearly cool in their cooking-stock; then trim them to a fine shape, and range them into another heat them at the entrance of the oven.

Wipe the meat then, tie it with thread, place it in a baldng-sheet, or on a roasting-pan; distribute on its top some blades of sage, baste it with a little butter or hogs lard; let it roast in a slack oven, for an hour and a half, turning it: pork must always be well done. Serve the loin on a dish, accompany it by a sauceboatful of good gravy, or else by ‘piquant’-sauce, ‘Robert’-sauce, or ‘poivrade’-sauce. - Roast loin of pork is an excellent dish, if eaten with a garnish of sour-crout. 620. Glazed ham, garnished with vegetables. Cut off the end of the knuckle-bone, slightly trim the surface of the meat, let the ham be dissalted in plenty of water, for some hours,BUTCHER’S MEAT. - HAM, PIG’S HEAD. 277 according as it may be more or less dry ; drain it, place it in a braising- pan 5 largely moisten it with water, let the liquid boil, and remove it back to the side of the fire, so that the ebullition may be only partial, and scarcely to be perceived. Boil the ham for nearly three hours according to its size ; but immediately, when the meat begins to soften, take it entirely oft’ the fire, leaving it in its cooking-stock ; it must finish cooking thus. Draw. 206. In order to glaze the ham, it must be removed when it has well set, but vet is not too much done : remove its swarth, trim it all round on the top, and at the side of the knuckle; put it back into the same braising-pan refreshed, pour over half a bottle of white wine, let the liquid reduce to three quarters ; add to it then a little good gravy or melted glaze, place the stewpan at the entrance of the oven ; let the ham glaze, basting it with its cooking-stock. At serving-time, dish it, and put a ruffle to it; pass the stock, skim off its fat, thicken it with a little sauce, pour it then into a sauceboat. Serve separately some spinach, green-pease, french-beans, braised cabbage, sour-crout, or else a garnish of mixed vegetables. 621. Pig’s head, with green-pease puree. Take the half of a fresh pig’s head, boned already, divide it into pieces of an equal size, singe them, and let them blanch; boil them, as is done to calf’s head. At serving-time, drain the meat, spunge it, dish it up on a consistent puree of green-pease, seasoned, and finished with a piece of butter. Serve separately a boatful of brown-sauce, thickened but little.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 278 622. Broiled cutlets of fresh pork, with gerkins. Take a fresh neck of pork (free of fat), shorten the hones of the ribs, remove those of the chine; cut six cutlets off each neck, taking them a little slantwise ; beat them, trim them ; season, and roll them in melted butter, breadcrumb them, let them broil for twelve or fourteen minutes, turning them. — Pour into a stewpan a quarter of a glassful of vinegar, let it reduce one third ; add to it double its volume of gravy; let the liquid boil, and thicken it with a little cooked Toux’; boil the sauce for a few minutes at the side of the fire, skim off its fat, pass it through a sieve; add to it a pinch of pepper, and some spoonfuls of chopped gerkins ; dish the cutlets in a circle, and baste them with the sauce. 623. Pork-cutlets, Robert-sauce. Cut seven or eight pork-cutlets, trim them to a nice shape, season them; place them side by side in a flat stewpan with hog’s lard; let them take color on a slow fire, turning them; drain their fat, and moisten them with a little white wine and good gravy; let the liquid boil, remove the stewpan back, on a slow fire, with hot embers placed on its lid; finish boiling the pork-cutlets, letting the moisture reduce to glaze ; then moisten them with some Robert-sauce (see art. 173) ; let them simmer in this sauce for a few minutes, free of ebullition. 624. Macerated minion-fillets of fresh pork. Trim two minion-fillets of fresh pork, remove the superficial skin on the top; put them into a kitchen-basin, salt them, pour over them a little cooked marinade (see art. 44), cover them with a sheet of paper; twenty-four hours after, drain them, and lard their surface with fine fillets of bacon. Spread a small deep baking-sheet with some minced vegetables, place the fillets on the top, moisten them to height, with the cooked marinade, and a little broth ; let the moisture reduce one third; remove then the stewpan back to the side of the fire, and braise the fillets for an hour; then drain them, lighten the moisture with a little sauce; give it a few minutes’ ebullition; pass this sauce, through a sieve, on the fillets, and serve them.279 - PORK-CUTLETS, COLD HAM.

Sausages with wine. Let fry in a pan fifteen small sausages; when they are nearly done, remove them; pour their fat then into a stewpan, mix into this fat two small handfuls of bread-crumb, let it fry for a few minutes, in order to give them a very little color ; then moisten it with half a bottle of whiteTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 280 'vine, and turn the sauce till ebullition (it must be light, and of a nice consistence); after the lapse of a few minutes, add to it the sausages, let them boil quite gently, tor ten or twelve minutes, then dish them, and pour over the sauce. 627. Household black-puddings. When in a household black-puddings are prepared, they are made in great quantities, as most generally this is done to utilise the blood of a pig killed at home. It will suffice therefore to describe this prepara- tion, in the proportions relative to the quantity of blood yielded by one pig- — For four quarts of blood is required a pint of cream or good milk, two pounds of onion, two pounds of swartli, or of pork-suet. First of all must be mixed into the blood, while it is warm, a quarter of a glassful of vinegar, put in by degrees, and without leaving off stir- ring the blood ; then are added to it a few blades of thyme. If fresh guts are employed they must be macerated (after having been well cleansed) in a basin, with a handful of salt, for two hours ; if the guts are dry, they must be softened in cold water. Pluck the onions, cut them in quarters, plunge them into a vessel of boiling salted water, boil them for seven or eight minutes ; then drain them on a sieve. Cut the swartli into small dice, put these dice into a stewpan, in order to warm them ; mix up with them the onions, and boil them for twenty minutes, then take them off the fire. — Pour the blood into a stewpan, passing it through a sieve; warm it then on a slow fire, without ceasing to stir it with a wooden spoon. When the blood is tepid, add to it the onion and swartli, take it off the fire, season it, add to it a little rum. Spunge the guts carefully, tie one of their extremities with thread, and with the aid of a large funnel fill them with the preparation at the opposite extremity. The gut may either be left whole, or tied at equal distances. Turn the black-pudding in a spiral way on the bottom of a large stewpan, largely cover it with tepid water; warm this water to the degree of ebullition, yet without letting the ebullition develop itself. Remove the stewpan, leave the black - pudding in the water, till the blood is281 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — BLACK-PUDDINGS, SAUSAGES. poached, that is, till it has got firm. Drain the black-pudding, let it cool in the air for five or six hours, previous to letting it broil. 628. Sausages with rice. Sausages are prepared with a pound of fresh bacon chopped, and a pound and a quarter of lean meat of pork, taken off the neck or shoulders of the animal. This meat ought to be chopped with the machine, then seasoned to high relish; to this mince is sometimes added a small quantity of crumb of bread softened ; some truffles, cut in dice, may also be mixed with it. Put into a large, and thin stewpan, fifteen fresh small sausages, which let fry on a slow fire ; drain them, leaving their fat in the stewpan; to this fat mix then a chopped onion, let it fry, then add to it two glassfuls of rice previously picked, washed, and dried on a sieve ; stir it with a spoon for two minutes, moisten it with three or four glassfuls of warm broth : give the liquid a few minutes’ ebulli- tion, add to it a bay-leaf, a bunch of parsley, a pinch of cayenne- Draw. 209. pepper, a clove, two tablespoonfuls of tomata-puree or sauce, and last of all the sausages ; when the rice is dry, take the stewpan off the fire, keep it at the entrance of the oven, for five or six minutes ; dish the rice, placing the sausages all round it. O11 a former page (drawing 33) has been given the design of a chopping-machine of English origin. The drawing attached to this article represents a machine of cylindrical shape. This pattern is very extensively used in all parts of France ; in large kitchens, and by pork- butchers, where work is carried on in large quantities. 629. Gratined sausages. Choose fifteen fresh sausages, of the length of three or four inches; slightly let them fry in butter on a slow fire. — Prepare some potato-282 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. puree of a nice consistence, finish it with some yolks ot eggs, and a piece of good butter, pile it, in a domelike shape, on a dish, which can be put into the oven; then dish the sausages all round this puree, mind applying them in an upright position one beside the other, but all in the same direction. Pour on this puree a little ot the fat ot the sausages, keep the dish in a slack oven, till the puree and the sausages be slightly gratinated ; immediately serve it. 630. Leg of lamb, with green-sauce. Cut round a fine leg of lamb, that is, without letting the loin adhere to it; shorten the bone, rub the surface of the meat with a pinch of flour. Put some water into a long stewpan with large vegetables, salt, pepper, and a bunch of parsley ; at the first bubbling plunge the leg into the liquid, boil it for three quarters of an hour: it must have set, just to the degree requisite; drain, and dish it; put a nice ruffle to the bone, then mask it with a green-sauce {see art. 151). 631. Boiled leg of lamb, with sorrel. Plunge into boiling salted water a small leg of lamb of very nice round shape; boil it for forty-five or fifty minutes. Drain it then, and serve it upon a sorrel puree. — Boiled leg of lamb may also be served with caper-sauce, just as boiled leg ot mutton. 632. Tart (tourte) of lamb-lights and liver (fraissure j. Boil the lungs (poumon) of a lamb in water for eight or ten minutes; drain it, cut it into middling-sized squares; cut the liver, and heart, into the same shape. - Melt in a stewpan a piece of chopped bacon, add to it the meat, let it fry for a few minutes on a brisk fire; season it, mix into it a few tablespoonfuls of fine-herbs: chopped and raw onions, shalots, and mushrooms; four or five minutes after, let the meat cool.

Roast quarter of lamb, ‘a la Bordelaise’. Trim the bone of a quarter ot lamb, which pierce tlnough with an iron-spit, tix it on the spit by both its extremities ; let the lamb roast at a good fire, basting it with butter; when it is nearly done, sprinkle over284 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. bread-crumb, which let take color, basting it with the fat of the dripping- pan ; salt the quarter of lamb, take it off the spit, dish it; surround it with a little good gravy, mixed up with some fresh, chopped leaves of mint; or serve separately a boatful of mint-sauce {see art 149). 634. Shoulder of lamb, stuffed. Bone two shoulders of lamb, leaving only the knuckle-bone ; diminish the thickness of the interior meat, which trim, chop, and pound ; mix it then with some veal stuffing; add to it a few tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, and with it, fill both the shoulders; sew the shoulders up, giving them a round shape ; place them in a long stewpan, the bottom of which is spread with trimmings of bacon, and with minced vege- tables; season them, moisten them, to a fourth of their height, with wine and broth; set the stewpan on a brisk lire, let the liquid reduce to glaze; moisten then again to half their height; finish braising them, basting them, in order to give them a fine color ; drain them, trim the meat of the knuckle-bone, to which put a ruffle. Dish the shoulders of lamb, and surround them with any garnish whatever. Serve separately their cooking-stock, passed through a sieve, its fat skimmed off, and reduced to half-glaze. 635. ‘Epigram’ of lamb. Boil two breasts of lamb in water or broth; when done, drain and bone them, keeping the bone of the ribs ; let them cool with a light weight on, then trim them suitably, and divide each of them into four parts, to which give the shape of cutlets ; season, and dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them; immediately range them in a flat stewpan, with melted butter, and fry them on both sides, turning them ; drain them, stick a little bone to each piece of breast, applying it to the pointed end. On the other hand, trim eight lamb-cutlets, season them, range them in a flat stewpan, and fry them on a good fire for twelve minutes ; baste them with a little melted glaze, put a ruffle to the bone of each, and dish them in a circle, alternating them with the pieces of breast. — Pour into the stewpan, wherein the cutlets have been cooked, four tablespoonfuls of white wine, give the liquid a few vigorous bubblings, thicken it withBUTCHER’S MEAT. — LAMB-SHOULDER., CUTLETS, SWEETBREADS 285 a glassful of reduced ‘bechamel’- sauce ; after the lapse of a few minutes’ ebullition, add to the sauce a garnish, composed of cooked lambs’ brains cut in pieces, some small glazed lamb-sweetbreads, and fresh fine cooked mushrooms ; give the liquid only one bubbling up, pour the garnish on the centre of the dish. 636. Broiled lamb-cutlets. Lamb-cutlets, if cut off a fine white and fat neck, trimmed tastefully, broiled to the degree requisite, give an excellent and most distinguished dish. — Trim the lamb-cutlets according to the same method, which is Draw. 212. applied to those of mutton ; dip them in melted butter, mixed with two yolks of eggs ; breadcrumb them, baste them with melted butter, range them symmetrically on a gridiron, let them broil, turning them; dish them, and accompany, either with a garnish of vegetables, or simply with a little good gravy. 637. Lamb-sweetbreads with Villeroi-sauce. Blanch a dozen lamb-sweetbreads, simply to set the meat; range them in a stewpan, moisten them, to half their height, with broth, which quickly reduce to glaze, so that the.meat cook during the reduction, but keeping it rather firm; let the sweetbreads cool with a light weight on, then cut each of them in two, dip them by turns into some ‘Villeroi’-sauce, and range them on a baking-sheet; when cooled, disengage them from the baking-sheet with the aid of a knife ; roll them in bread-crumb, dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them again. At serving-time, plunge them into plenty of hot frying-fat, let them fry, drain, and dish them.286 THE HOUSEHOLD COOIvEIiY-BOOK. 038. Lamb-cutlets, ‘a la jardiniere’. Trim fifteen fine lamb-cutlets, to an equal shape, proceeding accord- ing to the same method as applied to mutton-cutlets ; season, and range them on the bottom of a flat stewpan, masked with tepid butter 5 fry the cutlets on a brisk fire, turning them; when the meat has set to the degree requisite, drain the butter off the stewpan, baste the cutlets with a little melted glaze, roll them, over the fire 5 and dish them in a ciicle, on a border of potatoes ; then fill the hollow of the circle with a garnish of new vegetables: (see art. 77). Serve separately a sauceboatful of thickened gravy. 639. ‘Timbale’ of lamb-sweetbreads. Line a ‘timbale’- mould with short-paste (see art. 55); mask the bottom and sides of the case with a layer of veal force-meat with chives, mixed with a few spoonfuls of lean raw ham cut in fine dice. Blanch a score of lamb-sweetbreads, then fry them on a biisk fiie with some melted bacon ; season them ; two minutes after, take them off the fire, and let them cool; range them in layers into the timbale , altei- nating each of the layers with the remainder ol the force-meat; covei the top with force-meat, then with a round of paste, which solder to the out- sides with the utmost carefulness; set the ‘timbale’ on a little baking-tin, push it thus into a moderate oven. An hour after, remove it, turn it out on a warm dish; make a round aperture on the top, infilter into the in- terior a little thickened good gravy; put back the round that has been removed, immediately serve the ‘timbale. 640. Lambs’ feet, with curry-sauce. Singe sixteen lambs’ feet, which tie together by lour and four, let them boil in a white-stock, as indicated for the calf’s head. When done, drain them, remove the bone, range them in a saute-pan, and mix them up with cooked mushroom-heads, and poached ‘quenelles’; mask them with a good curry-sauce. — On the other baud, take some boiled rice, with which fill a dozen buttered ‘dariole’- moulds; as soon as the riceBUTCHER’S MEAT. — LAMB-FEET, MINCE, LIVER. 287 has got sufficiently firm, turn it out, and disli it in a fine circle ; dish the lambs’ feet in the hollow of this circle, masking them with curry-sauce, the remainder of which send separately in a sauceboat. 641. Minced lamb, with curry. Take the cooked meat of a leg of lamb, trim it, cut it in middling- sized dice. — Melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, add to it two table- spoonfuls of onion cut in small dice, let it fry to a nice yellow color; add to it twelve ounces or a pound of good rice previously washed, and dried on a sieve; warm it for a few moments, stirring it with a spoon •, imme- diately moisten it (to twice its height) with broth, ot which the fat has not been skimmed ; boil the rice on a slow fire, without covering the stewpan, and feeding the liquid from time to time, so that the rice do not get diy; when it is nearly at the degree requisite, add to it two small tablespoon- fuls of curry-powder, diluted with three spoonfuls of tomata-sauce; two minutes after, take it off the fire, add to it the lamb s meat; cover the stewpan, keep it thus for five minutes ; dish the stew. 642. Fried lamb’s-liver. Cut in thin slices two livers of lamb, season them on both sides, flour them, dip them into beaten eggs, plunge them into plenty of hot frying fat, taking but little at a time, so that the frying-fat does not cool; immedi- ately when the meat has well set, drain it, salt it, dish it in a group on a folded napkin, surround it with cut lemons. 643. Broiled lamb’s-liver. Cut into small slices two lamb’s livers, put them into a kitchen-basin, pour over them a little oil, season them, sprinkle over some chopped pars- ley, roll them in bread-crumb ; range them side by side on a gridiron, let them broil at a good fire, turning them, and basting them with oil, with the aid of a paste-brush, or simply with the aid of a little bunch, composed of some sprigs of parsley. As soon as the liver has set, dish the slices, basting them with a little oil mixed with chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon, or else with dissolved hotel-keeper’s butter (see art. 545).THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 288 644. Stew of lamb, with rice. Cut into middling-sized squares, a shoulder or brisket of lamb, put these into a stewpan with butter; let them fry on a brisk tire, until they have taken a nice color; add to them a little chopped onion, some tablespoonfuls of raw ham cut in dice, some salt, some pepper, and a clove of garlic; let them all fry for some minutes more, then moisten them to height with broth ; let the liquid boil for three minutes, then remove it back to a slow tire ; when the lamb is nearly done, add to it the rice requisite (a glassful of rice to two glassfuls of liquid); boil the stew again, for a quarter of an hour, in a stewpan kept Covered ; then remove it to the entrance of the oven, so that the rice may boil, preserving its grains whole ; when done, dish it. 645. Lamb-stew with artichokes. This is a simple dish, little costly, and requiring but little care or skill; it may be served for a luncheon of ‘amateurs’. — Trim seven or eight young artichokes, that is, very tender ; remove all the hard parts of the bottom and leaves, and cut each of them in two lengthwise; salt them,, and keep them by for after-use. Cut in pieces a small leg, or two necks, of lamb ; put this meat into a frying-pan with chopped bacon, a bit of sage, and a clove of garlic; season the pieces, fry them on a brisk fire, tossing them ; when they have taken a nice color, moisten them with half a glassful of white wine; add to them the cut artichokes well wiped; season the artichokes ; cover the pan with a lid, remove it back to the entrance of the oven; finish boiling the stew gently; when the lamb and artichokes are done, the gravy must nearly be reduced to glaze ; then add to it a little chopped parsley, and the juice of two lemons ; dish the stew, and surround it with the halves of artichokes. 646.

The various species of poultry and game yield considerable resources to the kitchen, not only on account ol their exquisite qualities, but also by the fact, that generally they adapt them- selves to very different kinds of preparation 5 indeed the meat of poultry, as well as of game, may be employed as roasts, as cold or hot entrees, aw removes, as ‘hors-d’oeuvre, nay even as an auxiliary for soups; neither beef, nor veal, nor any species of butcher’s meat, therefore, can bear comparison with them. The meat of poultry is by its nature of incomparable value; light and nourishing, it may lie digested by the weakest stomach. The meat of game, with but a few exceptions, yields the same advantages as that of poultry: both of them are equally esteemed by gourmets. 647. Turkey, with celery-sauce. Choose a middling-sized turkey, draw it, fill its breast with bread- crumb stuffing, or else with a mince of meat; solidly truss it, with its paws cut and re-adjusted (see the drawing 216); place the turkey m a braismg- pan, spread with some trimmings of raw fat, and with minced a egetables, celery, spices, and aromatics; moisten the turkey to half its height with291 POULTRY. — TURKEY. white-stock, or simply with broth and a little white wine ; let the liquid boil,’ remove the stewpan on to a slow fire; thus finish boiling the turkey, basting it, and sounding it from time to time in order to trace the pro- Draw. 216. gress of its cooking. — At serving-time, drain it on a baking-sheet, untruss it, dish it, and surround it with a celery-sauce (see art. 182).

Choose a turkey, not too fat, but good ; singe it, cut oft its paws and wings, bone it, proceeding, as directed art. 23. — The turkey being boned, remove the meat of the breast, distribute it in fillets, which put into a kitchen-basin, and season. Remove also the meat of the legs, which trim and chop. Chop a pound, or a pound and a quarter, of lean veal or fresh pork, mix it up with the meat of the legs of the turkey. Chop then an equal volume of fresh bacon, which mix up with the chopped meat; season the 19*THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 292 mince to high relish with salt and mixed spices pound it, put it into a kitchen-basin, add to it some plucked raw truffles, cut in dice or fillets, a piece of cooked and cut pickled tongue (taken from the tip), half a pound of cooked bacon, also cut; and some whole swelled pistachioes. Spread the turkey on the table with its open side uppermost; season the meat, then spread the force-meat in layers on the surface, alternating these layers with the fillets of the turkey’s breast. Gather the ‘galantine’, giving it a round and long shape, sew up its skin, wrap it up in a napkin, pressing it close 5 tie it with thread on both its extremities, then round its thickness, in the manner represented by the drawing. Place it in a long stewpan, surround it with vegetables, some fresh swarths, the bones of the turkey, and last of all, two blanched and cut calf’s feet; moisten it then to height with fresh broth, the fat of which has not been skimmed. Boil the ‘galantine’ for two hours on a slow fire 5 as soon as it is drained, unwrap it, wrap it up anew, trim it, glaze it with the paste- brush, dish, and surround it with aspic-jelly, either chopped, or else cut in ‘croutons’. — This aspic-jelly, is prepared with the cooking-stock of the turkey, proceeding according to the method prescribed, art. 130. — This ‘galantine’ may be served in slices. 649. Devild leg of turkey. Chisel slightly both the cold legs of a cooked turkey; sprinkle over some salt, and plenty of pepper; roll them in a little good mustard, diluted with some oil; let them broil at a moderate fire for a quarter of an hour, turning and basting them ; serve them on a hot dish with a little good gravy on the bottom. 650. Studded turkey, garnished. Choose a good small turkey ; cut off the paws at the joints, fill the stomach with a bread-crumb stuffing ; truss it, singe it in order to stiffen its meat; stud the meat, on the fillets and the legs, with squares of raw * jt is especially in the preparation of ‘galantines’, and ot cold-pies, that really good and well mixed spice is indispensable.293 POULTRY. - TURKEY. truffles cut to a point on one side ; let them form two rows on each side of the breast, and one row on each of the legs.

Place the turkey in a little braising-pan, moisten it to half its height with good broth unskimmed ; add to it a garnished Draw. 218. bunch, and some vegetables; cover the braising-pan, broil the turkey on a moderate fire, keeping it under-done, and immediately take it off the fire. With the turkey’s cooking-stock, passed through a sieve, and its fat skimmed off, prepare some good sauce ; let it reduce with some truffles’ trimmings; when it is at the degree requisite, pass it through a sieve, and keep it in the ‘bain-marie’. On the other hand, prepare a garnish composed of poultry cocks’- combs, truffles, and small ‘quenelles’. At serving-time, untruss the tur- key, dish it up, surround it with the garnishes ranged in groups, which mask with part of the sauce, sending up the remainder in a sauceboat. 651. Turkey-giblets, with vegetables. Take two turkey-giblets, that is, the neck, pinions, and crop, the liver, heart, and paws; carefully cleanse these various pieces, divide them, wash them in tepid water, spunge them on a cloth, keep the liver by. Cut into dice six ounces of blanched streaky-bacon, put it into a stewpan with butter, two or three small onions, and the giblets; let the meat fry, till it has taken a nice color; season, and sprinkle over a handful of flour, then moisten them to cover with broth, and a little white wine; give the sauce a few minutes’ ebullition, then remove the stewpan back on the side of the fire, and boil the meat quite gently; when they areTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 294 three-parts done, add to them a garnish composed of small carrots, tur- nips, and blanched small onions 5 season the vegetables, cover the stew- pan, finish the stew on a moderate tire, with hot ashes on the lid ot the stewpan, or else at the entrance of the oven; add the liver, last of all, as well as a spoonful of brandy. When the meat and vegetables are done, serve them in a deep dish, remove the bunch, skim the sauce, and pass it through a sieve over the meat. 652. Giblet-pie.

Chickens with curry. Take two middling-sized chickens, cut each of them into five pieces, without reckoning the body-bones and pinions; place the latter, as well as the legs, in a flat stewpan with butter, let them take color, turning them; when the legs are half-done, add to them the fillets and breast-pieces, season them only with salt; finish frying them on a slow fire. As soon as the chickens are done, remove the pieces with the aid of a fork, put them into a stewpan, and keep them covered. Put into the fat of the chickens, which remained in the stewpan, three minced white onions ; let them fry, stirring them ; as soon as they have taken a nice golden color, add to them half a pound of blanched streaky-bacon cut in thin squares; a fewr moments after, sprinkle over all two tablespoon- fuls of curry-powder, mixed up with a pinch of flour; boil it for two minutes, then dilute it with a glassful of good gravy, and the same of white wine ; let the sauce boil for five minutes, stirring it; add then the pieces of chicken; warm them without ebullition; finish the stew withTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 314 the juic$ of two lemons, serve it on a hot dish.

Cut up two tine and good chickens, into live pieces each ; put them into a stewpan, with a piece of butter, the pinions, body-bones, necks, and paws; add to them four ounces and a half of blanched streaky-bacon, cut in middling-sized dice. Set the stewpan on a slow tire, let the meat fry, stirring it with a spoon; season them, eight or ten minutes after, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour, let them fry again for some minutes, then moisten them to cover with warm broth, and a glassful of white wine. Stir then the liquid until it starts to ebullition, let the sauce reduce quickly for seven or eight minutes, then remove the stewpan back to the side of the tire. Fry, in a small pan, two or three dozen tender onions, salt them, add to them a pinch of sugar ; remove them with a skimmer, mix them into the stew : onions and chickens should prove done at the same time; if the onions were not tender, they must be previously blanched. — At serving-time, skim the fat off the sauce, dish up the chickens, surround them with the small onions ; reduce the sauce, if necessary, finish it with a liaison, and pour it over the chickens, passing it through a sieve. 685. Force-meat border, garnished with poultry-scollops. Butter a (lead or copper) channeled border-mould; fill it with raw poultry force-meat, cover it with a buttered sheet of paper, bet the mould in a saute-pan, with warm water just to half its height; let the liquid boil; cover the saute-pan, remove it back on a slow fire, so that the water is kept at the same degree ot heat, without boiling: this is what is called poaching or steaming in the ‘bain-marie’. Here is the method of preparing the poultry-scollops: take three raw chicken-fillets or one turkey-fillet; trim them, season them, wrap them up with bacon, put them into a saute-pan, with butter; let them tiy on stove or in oven, turning them; taking care not to do them too much; unwrap them, transversally cut them slantwise, into scollops, whichPOULTRY. — CHICKEN-BORDER, LEGS. 315 place in a stewpan; moisten them with white-sauce reduced, firstly with a little poultry-broth, and the raw trimmings of some mushrooms, then with a little cream, and thickened.

Mix into the cooking-stock four or five peeled, and chopped raw truffles, half a glassful of madeira, and a little sauce ; let the latter boil, pour it over the legs of chicken. 688. ‘Capillotade’ of chicken-legs. Take seven or eight cooked legs of chicken, trim them, and range them into a flat stewpan ; sprinkle over a little pepper, two tablespoon- fuls of chopped raw shalbts, and a few raw mushrooms, cut in dice; moisten them to height with white wine and gravy; let the liquid boil, immediately remove it back to the side of the fire, with hot embers on the stewpan-lid, or else keep it at the entrance of a slack oven. When the poultry is quite hot, thicken the cooking-stock with a little fine kneaded-butter, and add to it a few tablespoonfuls of madeira ; boil the sauce for ten minutes more, add to it a pinch of chopped parsley. Serve the chicken-legs on a hot dish, pour over them the sauce, alternate each lee: with a crust of fried bread. 689. Cliicken-pie. Cut two small chickens each into four parts ; season the pieces with salt and pepper; flour them slightly. — Mask the bottom of a pie-dish with some slices of raw ham, sprinkle them over with a little pepper, a pinch of minced shalbts and mushrooms.

Boiled pullet. Truss a good and tender pullet with its paws brought back, rub all its surface with the pulp of half a lemon, wrap it up with thin strips of bacon, shut it up in a little cloth. Let boil a stewpanful of water; an hour previous to serving, plunge the pullet into the liquid, let it boil, without allowing the ebullition to become less violent; it requires fifty minutes at least. — At serving-time, drain it, unwrap it, set it on a warm dish ; range at each end a group of cauliflowers, and at each side slices of cooked streaky-bacon ; very slightly mask the breast with a little parsley-sauce, serve up the remainder in a sauceboat. 693. ‘Supreme’ of chicken-fillets, with quenelles. Trim ten chicken-fillets according to the general rules, remove the stump of the wings ; slightly beat them with the handle of a knife, again trim them, round on one side, and pointed at the other (see draw. 242); range them on the bottom of a saute-pan, the bottom of which is masked with a layer of clarified and cooled butter; take care to place all the fillets in the same direction. With the trimmings of the fillets, and the meat of the two legs of chicken, one third part of panada, a third part of butter, and one yolk of egg, prepare some force-meat; with this force-meat mould fitteen or twenty small ‘quenelles’ with the aid of two tea-spoons {see art. 45); let them poach in salted water, keep them by. Spread the remainder of the force-meat on the bottom of a dish in a round and regular layer, cover it with a round of buttered paper.

Pullet ‘a la chivry’. Truss a fine pullet with its paws within, rub it with half a lemon, wrap it up with bacon, and let it boil in a good white-stock {see art. 30); at serving-time, drain it, untruss it, place it on a dish, slightly mask itTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 320 with good white-sauce reduced, mixed with a pinch ot diluted curry- powder ; surround it then with new onions of an equal size, emptied, boiled, and tilled at the last moment with a piece of ‘Montpellier’-butter % la ravigote’. 696. Pullet-mince with tcmatas. Take the meat of a cooked pullet, remove its skin and sinewy parts, divide it into small pieces. — Put into a stewpan two tablespoon- fuls of shalots, add to it a third of a glassful of vinegar, which let reduce to half; give the liquid a few bubblings up, then slightly thicken it with a little sauce; let the sauce reduce, until it is of a delicate taste; then add to it the pieces of pullet, which warm without ebullition; finish the mince with a pinch of chopped taragon, dish it up, surround it with a circle ot gratinated tomatas. 697. Pullet-pinions. Singe twelve pullet-pinions, bone them without opening them, salt them interiorly; then fill the hollow with a little raw force -meat, and sew up the aperture. Blanch the pinions in warm water for a fen minutes, simply to let them set; drain them immediately, trim them, pluck them carefully ; range them in a flat stewpan, spread with bacon, and minced vegetables; moisten them, to cover, with broth, the fat of which has not been skimmed ; cover them with a round of buttered papei, and boil them gently. — At serving-time, drain them, dish them in a group into the centre of a border of rice with gravy, or of risot, dished up; mask them with a little thickened good gravy, or else with white- sauce. 698. Larded and braised pullet, ‘a la Montglas’. Poultry and game are not so easily to be larded as butcher s meat, for the double reason, that their meat is more difficult to pierce, and that the rows of bacon are always inclined. In order to lard a piece of poultry well, its breast must be singed carefully, in order to let. the skm and meat set; but previous to being larded, the meat must have well cooled.321 POULTRY. - PULLET ‘A LTVOIRE’. The method of larding is the same, that already has been described (see art. 36), only the form is a different one. Previous to being larded, the pullet must be drawn, and trussed with its paws brought back (see drawing 244). Place the pullet in a stewpan spread with the remains of bacon, and with minced vegetables; let it boil short of moisture, glazing it to a nice color. On the other hand, prepare a bnontglas’ (see art. 40) composed of cooked pickled tongue, truffles, and mushrooms; place this garnish in a little stewpan, thicken it with a few spoonfuls of reduced good ‘bechamel’-sauce. Drain the pullet, untruss it, dish it up with the ‘montglas’ all round ; pass its cooking-stock through a sieve, skim off its fat, and pour it over the pullet. 699.

When it is at the requisite degree, take it off; with its cooking-stock, prepare a little white-sauce (see art. 139); skim off the fat, let it reduce with the liquor of a few mushrooms, thicken it with a liaison ol two yolks of eggs. — At serving-time, unwrap the capon, 21 Mask the capon’s breast with a large strip of bacon, slightly chiseled; Draw. 244.322 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. dish it up, surround it with a garnish ot cooked mushrooms, pour over the sauce, and serve it. 700. Pullet-livers in wrappers. Choose eight tine pullet fat-livers, remove their gall, plunge them into boiling water, drain them immediately, when they have set5 then divide each of them in two, season them with salt, and spices, mask them with a little cooked tine-herbs, wrap them up separately in small sheets of paper, cut as for lamb-cutlets, and oiled-, range them now on a gridiron, let them warm on hot ashes, or else at the entrance ot the oven, for fifteen minutes, turning them, but taking care to prevent the paper from becoming black. 701. Pullet-livers, sautes. Choose some good pullet-livers, trom which remo\ e theii gall. Chop an onion, let it fry with butter, without allowing it to take color; add to it the livers, and a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics; season, and toss them on a brisk fire, till they have well set; then remove them, and dish them up. — Pour into a stewpan half a glassful oi white wine, and a little gravy; let the liquid reduce to half, thicken it with a piece of butter, kneaded with a little flour and curry - powder; immediately pour the sauce over the livers, passing it through a sieve. 702. Gratin of pullet-livers. Remove the gall from a dozen pullet fat-livers ; divide each oi them in two; season them, let them fry in a pan, with butter on a brisk fire, in order to set it,. — At the bottom of a gratin-dish, and all round it, forma ring of raw force-meat, about an inch high; mask then the centre of the dish with a thin layer of grated bacon, mixed up with two tablespoonfuls of raw fine-herbs: chopped onions, mushrooms, and parsley ; range the livers in a group upon this layer, sprinkle over them fine-herbs, mixed up with bread-crumb, moisten them with melted butter, then push the dish into a hot oven. .

Stock-pot fowl, with curry. A fowl boiled in the stock-pot has the double advantage, of contri- buting highly to the goodness of the broth, and at the same time giving a very good appreciable dish, which may be served after the beef, without much pains or cost. Plunge a good, fat fowl into the stock-pot broth, an hour after it has been skimmed. — Half an hour previous to removing the fowl, prepare a little white-sauce {see art. 139) add to it two tablespoonfuls of curry-powder; when it is at the degree requisite, pass it through a sieve. Untruss the fowl, disengage both its legs, divide each of them in two, having first removed the paws ; cut then one fillet off each side of the breast, in order to be able to get five pieces ; range these pieces, as well as the legs, in a stewpan ; skim the fat off the sauce, which pass through a sieve, over the meat; let it simmer for a quarter of an hour, then thicken the stew with two yolks of eggs, diluted with a little cream, and dish it on a layer of rice, kept rather consistent. 704. Stewed fowl. Choose a large and fat fowl, singe it, draw it, wipe its interior with a cloth ; break the breast-bone with the point of a knife, in order to be able to remove it. — Prepare a fine mince of lean veal or pork, and bacon by halves, then with a piece of raw ham, a little handful of softened bread-crumb pressed out, a pinch of chopped onion, and another of chopped parsley; with this stuffing fill the interior of the fowl; sew up the breast, and the opposite aperture, truss it with its paws brought back. Melt in an earthen stock-pot half a pound of chopped bacon, to which add the fowl; let it take a light color on all its surface. Add to it a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, a clove of garlic, a hand- ful of morils or dry mushrooms, a large tomata cut in four pieces, some spices, and last of all, two boned calf’s feet, boiled in water for twenty 21*THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. minutes ; now moisten the foAvl with a large glassful ot white wine; at the first bubbling, remove the stock-pot back on hot ashes, surrounding it just to half its height; cover it with a common plate, half-filled with hot water: during three or four hours the liquid must only simmei ; two hours after, add to the fowl fifteen small onions, and a laigc canot cut up, both of which raw; keep up the ebullition at the same degree, until the vegetables and fowl are done ; then drain the fowl, untruss it, dish it up with the vegetables all round ; carefully skim the fat off the cooking-stock, pour it on the dish, passing it through a sieve. 705. Stock-pot fowl, with flne-lierbs. Take a fowl boiled in the stock-pot; drain it, divide it into six pieces; which range in a flat stewpan. — Let fry, in a stewpan with butter, three tablespoonfuls of chopped onions, and shalots; add to them two handfuls of dry mushrooms previously softened, and chopped, then a hunch of parsley garnished with aromatics; when the mushrooms have reduced all their moisture, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, moisten them with a little white wine, and gravy; stir the sauce until ebullition, then remove it back to the side of the fire; ten minutes after, skim its fat, pour it on the poultry cut up; add to it a few spoonfuls of cooked lean ham, or of pickled tongue cut in small dice ; let the stew simmer for ten minutes; finish it with a pinch of pepper, the juice of a lemon, and with chopped parsley; dish it up, and serve. 706. Stock-pot fowl, in marinade. Boil a good fowl in the broth of the stock-pot; let it half-cool, then divide it in four pieces; remove the skin and bones as much as possible, then again divide every one of the pieces in two; put them into a kitchen- basin, season them, sprinkle over some chopped parsley, moisten them with the juice of two lemons, let them macerate thus for half an hour. Twelve minutes previous to serving them, dip the pieces one by one into some frying-paste, in order to plunge them in plenty of hot frying- fat ; when the paste is dry, and of a nice color, drain the pieces of fowl, sprinkle over a little salt, dish them up.325 POULTRY. - GOOSE ROASTED IN THE OVEN. 707. Goose roasted in the oven. Only young and tender geese must be roasted on the spit; as soon as they are advanced in age, it is preferable to roast them in the oven; in this case, one must take care not to keep the meat under-done, else it would be tough ; it must be thoroughly done. Singe a goose, draw it, keeping the fat and giblets by ; carefully wipe the interior. — Prepare a mince of fresh pork, add to it two chopped onions fried slightly, a piece of softened bread-crumb, a pinch of chopped parsley or sage, and two whole eggs ; season it; with this stuffing, till the body of the goose; sew up its apertures, truss it, place it in a roasting- pan, of enameled cast-iron, of proportionate size, the bottom of which is masked with the cut fat of the goose ; add to Draw. 246. it some tablespoonfuls of hot water ; salt the goose, cover it with a sheet of buttered paper, let it roast in a slack oven, basting it repeatedly, and turning it ; when it is done, drain it, untruss it, dish it up; pour a little gravy into a roasting - pan, let it boil, skim oft’ its fat ; pass it through a sieve, serve it separately. Goose, roasted in the oven, may be served with a garnish of chest- nuts cooked with gravy, of savoy-cabbage, or sour-crout. 708. Stock-pot fowl for a salad. Having boiled a fowl in the stock-pot, let it cool, divide it in pieces; remove the skin and bones of the meat, which cut into irregular small pieces, kept not too thin ; season them with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar. — Prepare a vegetable-salad cut in dice (see art. 407), representing double the volume of the poultry ; season it; an hour after draining it; thicken it with a little limed mayonnaise (see art. 197).

Goose-giblets with vegetables. Take two clean goose-giblets, that is, when the gall has been re- moved from the liver, as well as the crop from the gizzard; keep the liver by ; then singe the pinions, and feet, divide the neck and gizzard. Put the meat into a stewpan, with a little melted goose-fat, a quarter off a pound of cut streaky-bacon, six small onions, a bunch ot parsley gar- nished with aromatics, and a little salt; let it fry, stirring it; when it has taken color, sprinkle over a spoonful of flour ; four or five minutes after, moisten them to cover with broth or hot water; stir the liquid until ebullition, then remove it back to the side of the fire; fry the meat, for three quarters of an hour, on a very slow fire. Cut, either in balls, or to the shape of corkscrews, some good carrots, and the’same quantity of turnips; cut them with the aid of acolumn- tube : if the carrots are not very tender, they must be blanched pre- viously ; let the turnips fry on a brisk fire in a pan with butter, sa t, and a pinch of sugar. Mix the carrots and turnips now into the stew, add to it a pinch of white pepper : the vegetables and meat should be done at the same time.POULTRY. — STUDDED FAT-LIVER. 327 There may also be added to the stew raw and cut potatoes ; in this case they must be added, when the other vegetables are nearly done. Twelve minutes previous to serving, let the goose-livers fry m a pan with butter; season them, divide, and mix them up with the stew; which dish up, having removed the bunch. 711. Studded fat-iiver. Choose a tine fat-liver, kept whole ; stud both its parts with a line of raw truffles, cut in fillets, which are square on one end, and pointed at the other. Season the liver, mask it with strips of bacon, then wrap it up in a sheet of buttered paper, setting it on the trimmings of the truffles ; place it on a baking-sheet with upturned rim, moisten it with butter, let it bake 'in a slack oven for thirty-five or forty minutes, repeat- edly moistening the paper. — At serving-time, unwrap the liver, dish it up, surround it with a garnish composed of ‘quenelles, mushrooms, truffles, etc: two species of garnish will do. Mask the bottom of the dish with a little brown-sauce, reduced with wine; send up the remainder in a sauceboat; the garnishes mentioned may be replaced by Perigueux- sauce ; if this be the case, the sauce is poured round the fat-liver. 712.

Moisten the duck again, to half its height, with broth and white wine, cover it up with bacon or greased paper, and braise it. When the duck is done, its cooking-stock should be reduced to half-glaze ; drain it then, untruss it, dish it up ; pass the cooking-stock through a sieve, skim off its fat, thicken it with a little good brown- sauce. Surround the duck with a mixed garnish, or simply with a garnish of vegetables; moisten it with a little sauce, the remainder of which serve up in a sauceboat. — The dish is represented by the drawing (249), as set upon a hot-water dish; let me recommend this method for all hot dishes, that are to figure on the table. 717. Young-duck, roasted. Choose a good fat young duck, singe it, draw it; chop its liver, and crop, with an equal volume of fresh bacon; season the mince, add to it a pinch of chopped onion, and parsley, a handful of grated bread- crumb, a pinch of sage-leaves, and one yolk of egg ; with this stuffing fill the body of the young duck, truss it, put it on the spit, let it roast for twenty-five or thirty minutes, basting it with butter; salt it, take it off the spit, untruss it; dish it up, garnish it with halves of lemon. Serve separately a sauceboatful of good gravy. 718. Ducks, hunter’s way. Truss two or three ducks, put them into a stewpan with butter, let them roast at a moderate fire. Let the livers of the ducks fry with some poultry-livers, or some slices of calf’s liver; when they have cooled, pound them, pass them through a sieve; mix up with this puree a little glaze, and then garnish with it some bread-crusts, cut to an oblong shape, and fried. The draw. (250) joined to this article, represents this entree placed on a bottom, serving it as a stanchion ; yet this bottom is not indispensable, and may be omitted.331 POULTRY. - DUCK-SALMIS. Fix to the centre of a dish a column or pyramid in fried bread ; mask it with quenelle force-meat, and thus let it poach at the entrance of the oven.

Salmis of young duck. Roast a young duck in a stewpan, with butter, without any other moisture ; keep the liver by. When the young duck is at the degree requisite, drain it, cut it in pieces, which trim, and range in a stewpan. Put the trimmings into the stewpan, wherein the young duck has been fried, add to it two glassfuls of red claret, a bunch of aromatics, some mushroom-trimmings ; cover the stewpan, set it on a brisk fire ; five or six minutes after, pass the liquid through a sieve, skim off its fat, thicken it with a little kneaded-butter or brown-sauce ; pass this sauce, through a sieve, over the pieces of the young duck, and keep them warm.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. On the other hand, mince two onions, let them fry with butter in a stewpan ; when they have taken a tine color, season them, moisten them with a little gravy, and finish doing them on a very slow tire ; then add the liver of the young duck, and two seasoned poultry-livers; fry them with the onions, then pound them together, and pass them through a sieve. Dilute the puree with the sauce ; dish up the duck, mask it with the sauce, surround it with crusts of fried bread. 720. Hot pigeon-pie. Singe and draw three good young pigeons, remove their feet, necks, and pinions ; divide their bodies, cutting each of them into three pieces; put these pieces into a stewpan with the pinions, and some chopped bacon, let them fry on a good tire; add to them a pinch of pepper, a little salt, six ounces of raw ham, a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics ; as soon as they have taken a nice color, add to them a table- spoonful of chopped onion, fifteen plucked raw mushrooms, cut in two; let the stew toss for some minutes, moisten it with a quarter of a glassful of white wine ; when the liquid has reduced, remove the stew off the fire, and allow it to cool. Prepare the pie, proceeding exactly, as said for hot lark-pie. When the pie is taken out of the oven, dish it up; open it on the top by cerning the cover ; moisten the meat with a little thickened and good gravy. 721. Stuffed-pigeons’ fillets. Take up the fillets of five pigeons, remove their minion-fillets, and trim them of the epidermis ; beat them with the wet handle of a knife, split them on the side, so as to open them without separating the parts ; season them witli salt and spices. Chop the trimmings, as well as the minion-fillets, with their same volume of fresh bacon; mix into this mince the cooked and chopped pigeon-livers, a small piece of lean cooked ham, and three or four table- spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, composed of onion and shalots, mush- rooms and truffles ; thicken the preparation with a little melted glaze; as soon as it has cooled, stuff with it the pigeon-fillets ; press them slightly, immediately dip them into beaten eggs, mixed with a little melted buttei;POULTRY. - PIGEONS. 333 breadcrumb them, range them on the gridiron, and broil them on a very slow tire for a quarter of an hour, turning them ; dish them up round a garnish of chicory with gravy, or a garnish of green-pease, alternating each of them with a crust of fried bread, glazed with the paste-brush. 722. Roast pigeons. Draw. 251. Pigeons must only be roasted, when young and tender. — Singe three or four pigeons, draw them, cut off the end of their pinions, and feet, remove the necks ; put the liver back into the interior ; truss them with two hooks, folding over the skin of the breast (see draw. 251), wrap them up in thin strips of bacon, tie them with thread, tile them on to a skewer from the side, and rather slantwise ; let the pigeons roast at a brisk fire for twenty-five minutes, basting them with butter 5 when they are done, salt them, take them off the spit, untruss, and dish them up, leaving the bacon on their breast, and pouring a little gravy on the bottom of the dish. — Wood-pigeons are roasted according to the same method. Draw. 252. 723. Broiled pigeons. Singe, draw and truss, three young pigeons ; split them along the back from one extremity to the other, so that they can be flattened with the aid of the cutlet-bat; when their interior has been removed on both sides, season, and roll them in melted butter ; breadcrumb them, and let them broil at a slow fire ; serve the pigeons with a little good gravy. 724. Pigeons, ‘a la Toulouse’. Chop half a pound of streaky-bacon, mix it up with an equal volume of chopped mushrooms, a pinch of shalots, and a little chopped parsley; a handful of bread-crumb, and a whole egg; with this stuffing fill the body of three fine pigeons, previously drawn ; truss them with their feet underneath the skin; wrap them up with thin strips of bacon, whichTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 334 fasten with thread, then tile the pigeons on a little iron-skewer, piercing them through their sides ; put them on the spit, and let them roast at a good lire for twenty-five minutes; when done, take them off the spit, untruss, and dish them up, mask them with a garnish composed of little ‘quenelles’, mushrooms, and poultry-livers, basted with a little white- sauce, reduced with the trimmings of the mushrooms and a little wine. These pigeons may be served also with some Perigueux- or tomata-sauce. 725. Compote-pigeons. Choose three young live pigeons, bleed them on the neck, gatheiing their blood, with which mix two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, in order to keep it liquid. — Pluck the pigeons, singe them, draw, and truss them with their legs folded back, and slipped beneath the skin ; place them in a stewpan, with butter, half a pound of streaky-bacon cut in squares, and fifteen tender small onions ; set the stewpan on a good fire, let the pigeons and vegetables fry, tossing them until they have taken a nice color; slightly salt them, sprinkle over a handful of flour; two minutes after, moisten them to cover with white wine and broth ; add to them a^ bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, and a pinch ot pepper; let the sauce boil, remove it back to the side ot the fire. At the last moment, add to them the livers. When the pigeons are done, untruss them, and dish them up; sur- round them with the garnishes ; remove the bunch out of the sauce, which then thicken with the pigeons’ blood; pour the sauce over the pigeons, passing it through a sieve. 726. Pigeon-cutlets, in ruffles. Singe and draw four young pigeons, cut them m two, along all then- length ; remove all the bones from the back and body, remove the pinion, bone the thick part of the leg, leaving but the end; then cut the paw at the juncture, whereupon split the skin of the pinion, at half its height; slip the finger beneath the skin, in order to let the end of the pinion- one pass by this aperture, and keeping it within ; slightly beat the halves ot pigeons with the cutlet-bat, and season them ; let them try slightly, on both sides, in a stewpan with butter.335 POULTRY. - COMPOTE-PIGEONS. On the other hand, prepare some fine-herbs (see art, 41), composed of shalots, onions, mushrooms, truffles, and some spoonfuls of cooked ham, chopped with the pigeon-livers, previously cooked; season this preparation, mix it up with the same volume of pounded fresh bacon, and a pinch of - chopped parsley. Mask the half-pigeons, on both their sides, with a layer of this preparation; fold these cutlets then up in oiled half-sheets of paper (see draw. 113, 114); range these rulfles on a gridiron, the surface of which is masked with an oiled sheet of strong paper; let them warm on hot ashes, or else at the entrance ot the oven, for twelve or fifteen minutes, but without blackening the paper ; then dish them up. 727. Pigeons with small onions. Truss three tender pigeons with their feet folded back, and intro- duced beneath the skin, by either one or the other of the methods represented by both the drawings ; put them into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of chopped and melted bacon, let them fry for a few minutes, add to them three dozen raw small onions ; salt the pigeons and vegetables, remove the stewpan back on a more moderate fire, or to the entrance of the oven, till the pigeons are done ; untruss them now, dish them up, and surround them with the small onions. Pour into a stewpan half a glassful of broth or gravy, let the liquid boil, skim off its fat, very slightly thicken it with a little piece of kneaded- butter ; pass this sauce then, through a sieve, over the pigeons. 728. Roast saddle of young wild-boar (marcassin). If wild-boar is to be roasted, it must be a very young animal, that is tender, fat, and not more than eight or ten months old. If the meat is tender, it is indeed excellent; but if tough, it is detestable. Draw. 254.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 336 Choose a small saddle, covered with a layer of fat, trim it square- wise, cutting the ribs short; place it in a deep dish, pour over it a pint of cooked marinade; let it macerate for two or three days, turning it from time to time; then drain it, wipe it, let it roast either on the spit, or in the oven, giving it from an hour and a quarter, to an hour and a half, and basting it repeatedly with fat; when it is three - parts done, moisten it with a few spoonfuls of the marinade ; at serving-time, drain it, and dish it up. Pass through a sieve the stock of the dripping-pan, skim off its fat, add to it a little good gravy, let it reduce to half, then pour it on the saddle; serve separately a sauceboatful of currant-jelly. 729. Wild-boar’s-head. The head of a wild-boar, boiled in its natural state, is to my thinking preferable to any other preparation; stuffed boars head is natuially a more luxurious dish, but its preparation is difficult and expensese. First of all, the boar’s head must be burnt or scalded,* in order to remove the hair, or bristles ; then disengage the meat from the end of the muzzle, in order to saw off its extremity; make an incision into the middle of the skull in the shape of a cross. The tongue of the boar must be left in its place, carefully removing the tube, and cleansing well the interior of the throat; for this proceeding, the boar’s head must be cut with its neck very long, this part being the most relishing one.. Rub the meat of the neck with saltpetred salt, place it m a basin, pour on vinegar, add to it some aromatics, keep it in the cool for three days. The eve before the day, when the boar’s head is to be served, drain it from this souse, wrap it up in a cloth, which tie up; place it in a braising-pan, surround it with aromatics, onions, carrots, peppercorns, juniper-berries, and salt; add to it the ears wrapped up separately. Moisten the meat to height with vinegar and water, let the liquid boil, remove it to the side of the fire; boil the boar’s head quite gently, from four to six hours, according to its being more or less tender; drain, and * If one would scald the boar’s head, either to scrape off its bristly hair, or to singe this with charcoal ; it must first be rubbed with powdered rosin, but in such a manner, that the powder may penetrate to the root of the hah.337 GAME. - VENISON, WILD-BOAR. unwrap it, refresh the cloth, wrap it up again, let it cool for eight or ten hours in its natural position ; then unwrap, and trim it; cut straight the neck-parts, put the ears back into place, sticking them on with a skewer, cementing the jointures with butter. Entirely glaze the surfaces, set the boar’s head on a long dish; adapt to each side of the muzzle two tusks imitated in butter, in order to give it, as much as possible, its original physiognomy. Mask the skull, on the opened part, with a rosette of aspic-jelly. — The meat of the neck being the best, it is first served; it must be cut in thin slices, and is served with Cumberland - sauce (see art. 203). 730. Larded saddle of venison, roasted. When the saddle is not very fat, the fillets, after removing their skin, may be larded with bacon ; but it must previously be left to mace- rate, for several hours, in a cooked marinade. Draw. 255. A saddle of venison may be roasted, either in the oven, or on the spit, basting it with butter ; it requires nearly two hours’ cooking. The roast saddle may be served with a madeira-sauce, finished with two spoonfuls of currant-jelly, and a pinch of lemon-sugar, grated on the rind. The saddle may also be served with a Cumberland-sauce (see art. 203). 731. Broiled brisket of young wild-boar. Boil the brisket of a young boar in some vinegar-marinade (see art. 729); when it is taken out of this stock, bone it, and let it cool with a light weight on ; then trim it, roll it in butter, and breadcrumb it; let it broil thus, at a slow fire, for twenty-five minutes ; serve it with some poivrade-sauce. — Briskets of small, tender, and fat, young wild-boarTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 338 (marccissi'n) can be broiled, when raw 5 only let them oe macciated foi a few hours, then wipe them well, and broil at a very slow tire. 732.

Cut the chops not too thin, remove the bones, but leaving the fat adhering; season them with salt and pepper, range them in a kitchen- basin, baste them with oil, let them macerate for twenty-four hours; at serving-time, broil them for twenty minutes, at a good fire, turning them ; dish, and glaze them simply with the brush ; serve them either with fried or mashed potatoes ; but in any case, serve separately some fresh butter. 733. Broiled Doe-cutlets. Cut, six fine cutlets off a breast of doe, simply removing the cliine- bone; trim the other end of the bone, very slightly beat the fillets, in order to break the grain of the meat; season, and range them on a dish, pour over some good oil, mask them with a minced onion, and some parsley-leaves : let them macerate thus for two hours, in a cool place. - A quarter of an hour previous to serving, range the cutlets on a gridiron, let them broil, on both sides, at a good fire, turning them; place them on a hot dish, pour over them some piquant-sauce, finished with two spoonfuls of currant-jelly. 734. Roebuck-cutlets, ‘a la Perigueux’. Trim eight roebuck-cutlets, season them, range them in a saute- pan with butter or oil, and let them fry, when done, drain off their butter, pour over a few tablespoonfuls of glaze, let the liquid reduce, then take them off the fire, and dish them in a circle. Fill the central hollow with a garnish of small game-quenelles, which slightly mask with ‘Perigueux’- sauce, the remainder of which send up in a sauceboat. 735.

For this preparation it is convenient to have at disposal half of a roasted or braised saddle of roebuck; if none such be handy, the cushion of a quarter of roebuck may be employed, but the tillets are preferable. However this may be, cut the meat in slices not too thin, trim these to an equal dimension: a dozen will be required at least, mask them with brown-‘chaufroix’-sauce (.see art. 206), dipping them one by one, by the aid of a large fork : they must remain coated with a layer of the sauce; range them gradually at intervals on a baking-sheet, and let the sauce cool; then remove the fillets, trim, and dish them in a circle on a layer of aspic-jelly, set on the bottom of a dish; fill the centre with chopped aspic-jelly.341 GAME. — ROEBUCK, HARE. 740. Roast haunch of roebuck. Saw off the end of the hone of a leg of roebuck, round it on the opposite extremity, having removed the bone of the ‘quasi’; then remove the sinewy skin on the side opposite to the cushion, and let the meat macerate, for rive or six hours at most, in a cooked marinade (see art. 44) ; then drain, and lard it with bacon, either transversally or length- wise. — If the haunch is to be roasted on the spit, pierce it through with an iron-skewer, which fix to the spit at both extremities. If it is baked in the oven, place it in a baking-sheet, moisten it with butter, and let it roast, from forty-five to sixty minutes, according to its size. A roast haunch of roebuck may be served with currant-jelly, poivrade-sauce or light piquant-sauce : the knuckle-bone of the leg must be trimmed and decorated with a ruffle. 741. Hare-boudins, with olives. Prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat with a fillet of raw hare, and the heart and liver cooked ; when it is finished, divide it into equal parts of the size ot an egg; put these parts on the floured table, roll them with the hand to the shape of corkscrews, flatten them with the blade of the knife, in order to give them an oblong shape : a dozen of them is requi- site. Let these ‘boudins’ then poach in salted water, drain, and let them cool; dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them; let them fry 'with butter, in a flat stewpan ; dish them up in a circle; pour into the centre some olive-garnish.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 342 742. Hare-fillets with ‘quenelles’. Trim the two fillets of a hare, removing the epidermis, cut them slantwise across, dividing each of them into five pieces ; moisten them, slightly beat them, trim them to the shape of poultry-fillets, season them with salt and pepper. — Pour into a flat stewpan some melted butter, range the fillets in this stewpan, placing them side by side. AN ith the bones and remains of the hare, prepare a little game-gravy, and with it, a little succulent sauce, thickened but a little. With the trimmings of the fillets prepare a little force-meat (see art. 123), and with this, form small ‘quenelles’ with the aid of a teaspoon; let them poach in salted water. A few minutes previous to serving, fry the fillets on a brisk fire, turning them: they must have set without being dry, and remain juicy in the interior; drain, and moisten them with four spoonfuls of the sauce, previously prepared, and dish them; pour over them the remainder of the sauce. — The fillets thus prepared may be served with a garnish of truffles, olives, mushrooms, or even chestnut-puree. 743. Stewed hare ‘a la daube’. When it is clear, that a hare is tough, the only means to make con- venient use thereof is, to prepare it in ‘daube’; in this condition, it furnishes an excellent dish, especially if it is large and fleshy. Cut into large pieces the shoulders, back, legs, neck, and head, of the hare; keep by, for after-use, the blood, liver, kidneys, and lungs; lard the meat with raw fillets of ham, and season them; add to this a bunch of aromatics, and a piece of dry orange-peel; moisten them with half a bottle of white wine, let them macerate in this seasoning for full twenty-four hours. Choose an earthen stock-pot, that has been used already ; mask the bottom and sides with strips of fresh bacon; place on the bottom a few small onions, and two or three cloves of garlic, then the head, bnskel, the neck and shoulder-pieces, of the hare; add to them a boned and blanched calf’s-foot, and a piece of raw ham: the legs, as well as the back, of the hare must be put on the top.

Beat the eggs with a whip for two minutes, introduce into them two or three tablespoonfuls ot raw cream, at the same time with the hare’s blood. Let melt in a frying-pan four to six ounces ot good butter; when it has become warm, beat the preparation quickly, and pour it into the pan; stir the omelet with a spoon, till it be nearly thickened, observing to keep it a little firm, of the same dimension as the pan, that is, flat and round ; as soon as it has set, turn it with the aid of a plate, taking care to drain the butter beforehand, which ought to be plentiful, and must, be brought back into the pan at the same time with the omelet. Keep the pan then at the entrance of the oven, in order to let the omelet simmer in its tat tor seven or eight minutes, then slip it on a lound dish, without folding it.345 GAME. - HARE, STEWED, AND ROASTED. 746. Roasted hare. In order to let a hare roast on the spit, it must indispensably be young. In the contrary case, it is preferable to prepare it in a stew. Choose a good hare, let it hang for at least four days in winter, as the meat of fresh hare commonly is tough and hard ; skin it only on the very day it is to be roasted, draw it, keeping by, for after-use, the liquid blood. Transversally cut off the upper end of the body beneath the shoulders, cut the breast, all along its length, so as entirely to disengage the back ; remove, or break, the bone of the thick part of the legs, then cut off the end of the hind-paws, in order to intertwine them by the sinew of the knuckle. Remove the sinewy skin of the hare - fillets, (a method which is preferable,) and lard them with bacon, in the order represented by the drawing 260 ; pierce the legs in a horizontal way with a small wooden skewer, in order to maintain them flat; then pierce the hare length- wise with a large iron-skewer, which fix to the spit at both extremities; moisten the larded parts with some butter, and let the hare roast at a Draw. 260. good fire, for forty or forty-five minutes, according to its size ; place a dripping-pan underneath the spit, with a little butter in it; repeatedly baste the hare while roasting; salt it, take it off the spit, and untruss it; put a nice ruffle to the ends remaining of the paws ; place the hare on a dish, and serve separately a light piquant-sauce. 747. Leverets, ‘a la Bretonne’. Divide in middle-sized pieces, the back and legs of one leveret, removing as much as possible the bony parts ; let them fry on a brisk346 TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY- ROOK. fire, in rasped melted bacon ; season them, add to the meat an onion, and a bunch of aromatics. When done, drain off their fat, moisten them with a glassful of white-wine : as soon as the wine is reduced, again pour over a little glaze, in which roll them. Dish the pieces of leveret in a group, mask them with a mince of onions, thickened with brown-sauce. 748. Saute of leveret, burgher’s way. Carve into pieces of an equal size, the shoulders, legs, back, and neck, of a leveret, previously skinned, and drawn; put aside the blood, liver, heart, and lungs. Let melt in a flat stewpan a quarter of a pound of chopped bacon; add to it the pieces of leveret, half a pound of blanched streaky-bacon cut in squares, and two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion; season the meat, add to it a bunch of aromatics; let the pieces fry for a few minutes on a brisk fire; as soon as they have set, remove the stewpan back on a slow fire, or to the entrance of the oven ; finish boiling the leveret quite gently. Drain off the fat, pour on the meat a little thickened gravy, and a little wine; add to the stew the liver and heart of the leveret, cut up, as well as a dozen fresh mushrooms, each of which is divided in two transversally; let the sauce boil vigorously for ten minutes, then thicken it with the leveret’s blood, kept by for that purpose; finish it with a drop of vinegar, dish the stew up. 749. Saute of leveret, with truffles. Cut up a good leveret, put it into a stewpan with melted bacon, season, and let it fry on a brisk fire for seven or eight minutes; add to it an onion, a bunch of aromatics, and some trimmings of raw ham; cover the stewpan ; when the meat is nearly done, add to it a few raw truffles, cut in slices, and seasoned; moisten them with half a glassful of white wine, set the stewpan; toss them from time to time; when the liquid is reduced to glaze, place the meat, as well as the truffles, on a hot dish; pour into the stewpan a glassful of brown-sauce, let it reduce for a few minutes, skim off its fat, pour it on the dish.347 GAME. — HARE-OMELET, POTTED : LEVERET. 750. Potted-liare (terrine). Trim and chop the meat of the legs, and shoulders of a hare, with their same weight of fresh bacon ; put the meat into a mortar, season it, pound it, and pass it through a sieve. Cut in slices the half of a small calf’s liver, range them in a pan with butter or hog’s lard, season them, let them fry, until they have well set; remove them off the fire, let them cool, then cut them in pieces, and pound them; add to them the force-meat previously prepared, pound both together for ten minutes, then pass it through a sieve. Cut in squares the fillets of the hare, add to them their equal volume of blanched bacon cut in dice, as well as some cut truffles ; season them, mix them with the force-meat. Put this pre- paration into an earthen pan or jar (see drawing 261), able to resist the heat of the oven, the bottom of which has previously been masked with strips of bacon ; cover also with bacon the preparation, and the bacon with a round of common paste; set the jar on a deep baking-sheet, push it into a slack, but well heated oven ; bake it an hour and a half, or two hours ; let it cool well previous to serving it. 751. Farced leveret, farmer’s way. Take a skinned leveret, draw it, singe it, and lard it with bacon; fill the hollow of the breast with force-meat prepared thus : let fry the liver, heart, and lungs, of the leveret in a frying-pan with bacon, aro- matics, onion, and parsley ; season them, then pound, and pass them through a sieve; mix up, with this puree, double its volume of bread- crumb, and one whole egg. When the leveret is filled, truss it, let it roast, basting it with melted butter; when it is done, salt it, take it off the spit, dish it, and baste it with the following sauce : Put into a small stewpan, a chopped onion, a bunch of parsley and aromatics (thyme, bay-leaf, wild thyme) ; add four or five tablespoonfuls of ham in small dice ; moisten with a large glass of white wine, and reduce the liquid to half, then add to it a few table-THE HOUSEHOLD COOKE MY-BOOK. 348 spoonfuls of good gravy, or melted glaze ; two minutes after, thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter; dissolve the butter by stirring ; at the first bubbling, draw the sauce off the fire, remove the bunch, and. add to it a pinch of pepper, a little chopped parsley, and two tablespoonfuls of capers. 752. Blanquette (white-stew) of field-rabbits. Cut into pieces two rabbits, put them into a stewpan with melted butter and two small onions; let them fry, season, and add to them six ounces of raw ham, cut into small squares ; five minutes after, sprinkle over a handful of Hour, moisten them to cover with broth and white wine; stir the liquid until ebullition, add to it a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics, and fifteen fresh mushrooms. Boil the meat quickly for seven or eight minutes, in order to let the sauce reduce one third; immediately remove the stewpan back on the side of the fire. At serving- time, skim the fat off the sauce, and thicken it with two yolks of eggs diluted; finish the stew with the juice of a lemon, a pinch ot pepper, and another of chopped parsley ; serve it on a hot dish, removing the bunch. 753. Boiled rabbit. Take two or three well-cleansed rabbits; fasten the legs with small wooden skewers, plunge them into boiling water, salted; add a bunch of aromatics, cook them for forty minutes; drain them, and range them on a dish; mask them with a mince of blanched onions, fried with butter, seasoned, then thickened with a little ‘bechamel’- sauce. Range round the rabbits a circle of slices of streaky-bacon, broiled or fried. 754. Rabbit-pie or tart (tourte). Take the legs, and back, of two good field-rabbits, well cleansed; divide them into middling-sized pieces, remove the bones as much as possible; put the meat into a stewpan with scraped bacon, and six ounces of streaky-bacon or raw ham; let them try on a good fire, stirring them; season them, add some fresh mushrooms cut in pieces; moisten them with a glassful of white wine ; cover the stewpan, let the liquid reduce, take the meat off the fire.349 GAME. - RABBIT, BOILED, STEW, PIE: COLD IIARE-PIE. On the other hand, prepare a pound, and six ounces, of veal force- meat (see art. 110), to which add a pinch of chopped parsley. Spread, on a round baking-sheet (tourtiere), a round flat of short-paste; on its centre spread a layer of force-meat; upon this force-meat range the rabbit-pieces previously cooled, raising it in a dome; mask the meat with the remainder of the force-meat (see the drawing 210); wet the Draw. 262. edges of the flat of paste, then cover the dome with a flat of puff-paste, kept not too thick, and finish the pie as directed, art. 632 ; bake it for an hour; take it out of the oven, slip it on a dish, open it, cerning the dome, and pour into the interior some spoonfuls of good sauce. 755. Cold-pie of hare. Cut in long square pieces, two raw hare-fillets, mix these pieces up with their equal quantity of bacon, cut in the same shape; season them Draw. 263. to high taste. Cut up the meat of the legs, mix them with an equal quantity of calf’s liver, put them into a stewpan with melted bacon, season them, let them fry on a good fire ; as soon as the meat has well set, let it cool; pound it, and pass it through a sieve; then mix it up with an equal quantity of mince of fresh raw pork, chopped very fine, pounded, and seasoned.350 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Roll out twelve or fifteen ounces of short-paste (see art. 55, 57) to the shape of a long square ; mask it on its centre with a thick layer of force- meat ; and upon this layer, place then the remainder of the fillets and bacon ; mask all this with a layer of force-meat; fold the edges of the paste over the meat; moisten, and cover it with a thin strip of the same paste, upon which place again a strip of puff-paste; into this strip of puff-paste, manage to make three small apertures, which place at a little distance from one another; then egg, and rule it with the aid of a small knife. Wrap up with a strip of buttered paper the basis of the pie, in order to maintain it in shape; bake it in a slack oven, for full two hours ; cover it with paper, as soon as the paste begins to take color. Twenty minutes after the pie is taken out of the oven, infilter into it, by its top, some spoonfuls of aspic-jelly; when it has well cooled, serve it. 756. Roast heath-cock. When heath-cocks are no longer young and tender, it is convenient to remove the skin of the breast, and to lard its meat with bacon ; in this condition let it roast on the spit, basting it with butter, and keeping it under-done. It requires the same cooking-time as pheasant. 757. Roast wild-duck, ‘a la Provencale’. The wild-duck is a wandering bird, common in Europe; its species are various and abundant, the best being those living far distant from the marshes, and on quickly running waters. — Pluck a wild-duck, remove all its down, singe it, draw, and wash its interior, changing the water several times, then spunge it well. Prepare some panada with softened bread-crumb pressed out; add to it one chopped onion, and a pinch of chopped parsley; season the stuffing with salt and pepper, add to it a whole egg, and with this, fill the body of the duck ; truss it, wrap it up in a sheet of oiled paper, let351 GAME. — HEATH-COCK, WILD-DUCK, GUINEA-FOWL. it roast on the spit for twenty-live minutes ; unwrap it a little time before taking it off the spit; salt it, untruss, and serve it accompanied by piquant-sauce (see art. 172) finished, with a little anchovy-butter. 758. Guinea-fowl, ‘a la financiere’. Singe and draw a guinea-fowl, remove the breast-bone; till the body with some quenelle-force-meat, mixed up with two raw truffles cut in dice. Truss the guinea-fowl with its paws brought back, lard it with Draw. 264. bacon on the fillets and legs ; place it in a stewpan, spread with remains of bacon and vegetables; season, and moisten it with two gills of white wine ; let the liquid reduce to glaze ; then moisten it once more with four gills of broth, and let it braise on a very slow tire ; last of all, glaze it, to a nice color, with its own cooking-stock reduced. On the other hand, prepare a ‘financiere’- garnish composed of button-mushrooms, truffles, cocks’-combs, small ‘quenelles’, and large ones which are nicely decorated ; but it is nowise rigorously necessary that all these costly elements be combined ; in smaller kitchens, where the means are limited, one must shift as one can. These garnishes may either be mixed together, or dished up in groups : the large decorated ‘quenelles’ are placed on the sides of the guinea-fowl; but previous to applying them, the garnishes must be masked with some good ‘financiere’- sauce, that is, brown-sauce reduced with the skimmed cooking-stock of the guinea-fowl, some trimmings of truffles, and a little good dry white-THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. wine. Stick on the centre of the guinea-fowl a little fliatelet’- skewer, garnished with a truffle, and a large cock’s-comb. 759. Game-salad. With grouse, partridge, and pheasant, excellent salads may be pre- pared. — Divide the game into joints or pieces, remove the skin, and bones as much as possible ; season them, pour over oil and vinegar, keep them in a cool place for a few hours. — Mince some fresh and well- washed lettuces, season, and thicken them with a little mayonnaise- sauce ; place them on the centre of a cold dish; upon this salad then dish, in a pyramid, the pieces of game, mask them with a layer of mayonnaise with eggs, and surround them with a circle of halves of eggs boiled hard. 760. Grouse-pie. The grouse must be chosen young. — One proceeds according to the same method, as tor pigeon-pie. 761. Cold-pie of pheasant. Bone a good pheasant, divide its meat into pieces, which place in a kitchen-basin, together with six plucked raw truffles; season, and poiu over them a little madeira-wine ; let them macerate thus tor an horn. Trim the meat of two legs of hare, cut it into pieces, which let fry slightly with the pheasant-liver; when the meat has cooled, mix it up with an equal quantity of lean veal, or iresli pork; chop, and pound them together with the same weight of chopped fresh bacon; then add to it the trimmings of the truffles; season this force-meat, add to it six ounces of cooked bacon cut in dice, the pheasant-pieces, as well as the truffles. . Line a cold-pie mould with short-paste (see draw. 158), garnish it and finish it, proceeding as indicated in the art. 487. Bake the pie tor two hours ; twenty minutes after it is taken out of the oven, infilter into it a glassful of good gravy, prepared with the body-bones of the pheasant, some trimmings of meat, the trimmings of the truffles, a little wine, an a little aspic - j-elly.353 GAME - GROUSE, PHEASANTS. 762. Young-pheasant (faisandeaux) roasted, with cresses. These pheasants {faisandeaux), are the young brood, not having yet reached their full development. In the North young pheasants yield a good dish from the beginning of September. — Draw two young phea- sants ; let their livers fry, mixed with a few poultry-livers; pound them with an equal quantity of fresh bacon ; season, and pass them through a sieve; with this force-meat fill the bodies of the pheasants; truss, and pierce them with an iron-skewer, which fix on the spit; let them roast Draw. 265. at a good fire, without wrapping them up in bacon, but carefully basting them with butter: twenty minutes will do. Take them off the spit, dish them up, surround them with cresses ; serve separately a little good gravy. 763. Roast pheasant, with Perigueux-sauce. If one wishes to eat a good pheasant, it must be chosen tender and fat, and not too severely damaged by the gunshot; then suspend it by its paws, hanging it up on a dry and cool place, with its neck down- wards. When it is become tender to the degree requisite, that is, when some liquid drops flovr from its beak ; pluck and drawr it; put the liver back into the body, singe and truss the pheasant; pierce it through with an iron-skewer, which fix on the spit, taking care to fix the paws. Make up a good fire underneath the spit, let the pheasant turn ; then place beneath it a thoroughly clean dripping-pan, with slices of bread ranged on a gridiron, placed immediately under the pheasant, which baste with 23THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 354 butter, with the aid of a paste-brush: at the outset ot the roasting, it is convenient to keep the spit a little distant from the lire, carefully approaching it by degrees. Let it roast from thirty-five to foity minutes, previous to taking the pheasant off the spit, remove the bread-crusts out of the dripping-pan; then salt it, and pour over two tablespoonfuls of madeira; then take it off the spit, untruss it, serve it on a hot dish. Serve separately a sauceboatful of Perigueux-sauce. 764. Simplified salmis of pheasant. Draw and truss a pheasant, wrap it up m bacon, place it in a stewpan with a little scraped bacon, some remains of ham, the neck and the gizzard; let it fry on a slow fire for a quarter of an hour; moisten it with a glassful of white wine; add to it a bunch ot aromatics, and a handful of truffle-pluckings ; let the liquid boil, remove the stew- pan then to the entrance of the oven. Put into another stewpan the liver of the pheasant, and a few poultry-livers, let them fry with butter on a brisk lire, season them; when they have set, let them cool, and pound them with apiece ot buttery dilute them with a little sauce, and pass them through a sieve. - ihe pheasant being done, drain it on a baking-sheet, untruss it, cut it into eight pieces; remove their skin, glaze them, shut them up m a little stewpan, and keep them warm. Pound the body-bones, and the trimmings of the pheasant in a mortar put them into the stewpan, wherein the pheasant has been pre- pared, having drained off its fat; add half a glassful of madeira-w.ne, and a little gravy ; give the liquid a few babblings up, pass it tln-oug i a napkin, which is wrung by two persons. With this gravy graduaUy dilute the liver-puree, add to it three minced truffles cooked at the moment; stir the sauce until ebullition, pour it over the pheasant-pieces, which then range on a warm dish, and mask them with the sauce. 765. Game-cutlets with olives. Prepare a ‘salpicon of cooked game: etc. .repare a saipicuu ui ± ~ ‘ ^ place it in a little stewpan, add to it half its volume of cooked355 GAME. — PARTRIDGE-CUTLETS, AND GALANTINE. truffles and mushrooms, in equal parts, and cut in thin dice like the game; now thicken this ‘salpicon with some brown-sauce reduced with a little glaze : the sauce must not be too abundant. Season the preparation with a pinch of nutmeg, spread it on a baking-sheet, in a layer ot the thickness of a third of an inch ; let it cool well, then cut out ot this preparation a dozen pieces of the shape ot cutlets; mask them, over all their surface, with a thin layer of raw ‘quenelle' force-meat; dip them into beaten eggs, bread- crumb, and plunge them into hot frying-fat, taking but a little at a time ; when they are well drained, dish them up in a circle ; then till the hollow of this circle with a garnish of stoned olives, very lightly blanched, and mixed up with a little brown-sauce. — After the same method, may be prepared cutlets of either poultry, lobster, or crayfish. 766. Partridge-Galantine’, ‘a la belle-vue’. Transversally cut into slices a partridge-‘galantine’, let the slices not be too thick; trim them to an equal diameter, and oblong shape ; glaze them with the aid ot a paste-brush, then apply on the centre of each of them a slice ot cooked truffle. Range then the ‘galantines’ side by side, on the bottom of a saute-pan, masked with a layer of - set aspic-jelly ; this saute-pan must be placed firm, and upright on the ice. Immediately pour between the 'galantines' some cold and liquid aspic-jelly, so that it Draw. 267. comes up just to the height ot the slices. Let this aspic-jelly set well, then cern each ot the slices with the point ot a small knife, cutting the aspic- jelly , dip then the bottom ot the saute-pan into warm water, in order to remove the galantines’, to which the aspic-jelly should adhere; dish them, and surround them with chopped aspic-jelly, or jelly-‘croutons’. 767. Pheasant with chestnut-puree. When a pheasant is no longer tender, one must never risk roasting it, far better is it to have it braised or stewed. — Draw and singe a pheasant; fry its Jiver, and pound it with double its volume of chopped 23 *THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 356 bacon; with this preparation till the body of the pheasant; truss it with its paws brought back, lard it with bacon on the two fillets, and on the legs; place it in a stewpan, spread with remains of ham and bacon, as well as with some minced vegetables; slightly salt them, add to them a bunch of aromatics ; moisten to the height of the legs with broth and white wine; let the liquid reduce to half; remove the stewpan back on a slow fire with hot ashes on the lid, or else at the entrance of the oven; boil it quite gently, repeatedly pouring on its own cooking-stock. — At serving-time, moisten the pheasant by the aid of the paste-brush dipped into melted glaze; let it take color; then drain it, untruss it, and place it on a chestnut-puree, disposed on the centre of a dish; pass the cook- ing-stock through a sieve, skim off its fat, and with it, moisten the pheasant. 768. Pheasant-mince. Take the meat of a cooked pheasant, remove its skin, cut it into slices, and range them in a middling-sized stewpan ; keep them covered. Break up the bones, put them also into a stewpan with minced vegetables, trim- mings of ham, a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, a little white wine, and a little broth, in order to prepare a pheasant-extract. — Let fry in a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, add to it two handfuls of raw and chopped mushroom-trimmings ; when the mush- rooms have reduced their moisture, sprinkle over a handful of bread- crumb, moisten them with the extract previously prepared, give the sauce three or four minutes’ ebullition, add to it the pieces of pheasant, warm them without ebullition; add a pinch of pepper, another of chopped parsley, a spoonful of Harvey-sauce, and the juice of a lemon; serve this stew- in a warm dish. 769. Partridges with bread-sauce. Singe and draw two good partridges, prepare a little stuffing with their cooked and chopped livers, a piece of softened bread-crumb pressed out, a pinch of chopped onion and parsley, salt and pepper. ^ it i t n. stuffing fill the partridges; truss, and place them in a stewpan wit357 GAME. - PHEASANT ; PARTRIDGES, ROAST, AND SALAD. butter, let them roast on a good tire for fifteen or twenty minutes, bast- ing them carefully ; slightly salt them, drain them, untruss them, and dish them up ; put into the stewpan, wherein the partridges have been roasted, a pinch of chopped shalots, let them fry for a few moments, and add to them two handfuls of bread-crumb, let it fry slightly, gradually moisten it with half a glassful of broth ; add to this sauce a piece of glaze, let it boil, then take it off the lire; finish it with the juice of two lemons, a pinch of parsley, and some pepper ; pour the sauce on the partridges. 770. Roast partridges. The partridges, destined to be roasted, may be either larded, or wrapped up in bacon, if done on the spit. Partridges may however be roasted either in the oven or on the spit; yet the latter is certainly preferable. Draw two line partridges, truss them, lard or wrap them up in bacon, pierce them through (filing them on) with an iron-skewer, which fix to the spit; roast them at a good fire, lor twelve or fifteen minutes, bast- ing them with butter; salt them previous to taking them off the spit; dish them up, either whole or carved ; surround them with halves of lemons, serve up a little good gravy in a sauceboat. — Heath- pout (cjclmotte) is roasted in the same manner. 771. Partridge-salad. Take two cooked partridges, divide each of them into six pieces : two legs, two fillets, and the breast-piece split in the middle lengthwise; remove the skin and bones as much as possible; place them in a kitchen- basin, moisten them with oil and vinegar, season them ; two hours after, drain, and place them on a layer formed of vegetable-salad, alternating the pieces of partridge with some mayonnaise-sauce, mask the pyramid also with mayonnaise, surround it at its base with hearts of lettuce. Draw. 268. Draw. 269.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 358 772. Partridge-cutlets with Colbert-sauce. Draw and singe three young tender partridges, cut each ot them in two lengthwise, then split the meat of the pinion-bone of each leg ; intro- duce the finger between the skin and meat, in order to bring the paw back into the aperture by folding it, and making it come out on the opposite side; slightly beat each half-partridge, trim them, diminishing as much as possible the bones of the sides ; season them on both their sides with salt and pepper, roll them in melted butter, breadcrumb, and broil them on a slow fire for twelve minutes, turning them ; when done, dish them up, pour on the bottom of the dish some good Colbert-sauce (see art. 180). 773. Partridge-‘pain’ with aspic-jelly. Pound the meat of two cooked partridges, and their livers, with a piece of good butter; season, and pass them through a sieve. — With the body and other bones of the partridges prepare a little game-sauce, which let reduce with a little madeira - wine; when it is at the degree requisite, add to it a glassful of very firm aspic-jelly ; with this sauce, dilute the partridge-puree, which then pour into a plain cylinder-mould, place this mould in a basin, surround it to height with pounded ice, m order to let the preparation get firm. — An hour after, quickly dip the mould in warm water, and turn the ‘pain' out on a cold dish. 774. Legs of partridge, in ruffles. When an entree of partridge-fillets has been served, there is a process of utilising the legs. # Take a dozen raw legs of partridge ; bone them, leaving only the pinion-bone, cutting the paws at the joint. Place the legs in a flat stew- pan with butter, let them fry on both sides; sprinkle over two table- spoonfuls of chopped onion, and a handful of fresh mushrooms, also chopped ; remove the stewpan back on a slow fire, or to the entrance ot the oven ; when the moisture of the fine-herbs has reduced, the legs should prove done; let them cool in the stewpan, and take them out; then mixGAME. - PARTRIDGE-CUTLETS, ‘PAIN’, SOUR-CROUT, PUR&E. 359 into the tine-herbs half their volume of rasped bacon, and a spoonful of chopped truffles ; with this preparation mask the legs on both sides; wrap them up separately in oiled paper, folding it all round; range them on a gridiron, and heat them on a very slow fire, without blackening the paper ; then dish them up. 775. Partridges with sour-crout. Take the crust of a fat-liver pie of Strasburg, already emptied; wrap it up with a few leaves of paper, which fasten with thread, and set Draw. 270. the crust on a baking - sheet; let it warm in a very slack oven for a quarter of an hour. — On the other hand, boil two pounds of good sour- crout with the fat removed from off the pie, and a piece of blanched streaky-bacon ; when it is nearly done, add to it two partridges; last of all, drain the meat and sour-crout on a colander; cut each of the par- tridges in five pieces, cut the bacon in slices after trimming it. Place then the sour-crout in the pie-crust in alternate layers of partridges, bacon, and some slices of raw truffles ; cover the pie, keep it in a slack oven for half an hour; when it is taken out, pour over the meat, and sour-crout, a little brown-sauce reduced with wine; dish the sour-crout up, accompany it with a boatful of the same sauce. 776. Partridge-puree, with poached eggs. When a dish of roast has been served, this dish can be easily pre- pared with the remainder of the roast, to be served for luncheon. As360 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. much as possible should be employed the meat ot the breast and thick part of the legs, that of the drumstick being too sinewy. Cut up the meat, put it into a mortar with two or three tablespoontuls ot cooked rice; as soon as the meat and rice are braised, mix into them two tablespoonfuls of sauce, and pass them through a tammy. Put this puree into a stewpan with a piece of good butter, season it, baste it with a little glaze 5 warm it without ceasing to stir it, but not allowing it to boil; dish it up, sur- round it with a few poached eggs (see art. 803) ; pour over the puree a little good gravy, got from the bones and body of the partridges. 777. Salmis of plovers, or lapwings. Remove the crop and gizzard from four plovers ; singe them, truss them without drawing them ; wrap them up in bacon, let them roast, either on the spit, or in the oven; when they are done, divide each of them in four pieces, remove their bones and superfluous skin, range them in a stewpan, setting the legs underneath, and the fillets uppermost; glaze them with the paste-brush, and keep them in the ‘bain-marie’. — With the body-bones of the game prepare a little extract (see art. 126), and finish the salmis, as that of thrushes (see art. 786)'. 778. Hot plover-pie, on a dish. Singe three or four plovers, draw them, cut each of them in two, season them Avitli salt and pepper. Mask the bottom of a pie-dish with some thin slices of raw ham; sprinkle over a chopped small onion, range on top of these the halves of plovers, surround them with some raw mushrooms, and two or three eggs boiled hard and cut in two ; moisten the game, to half its height, with a little cooled gravy, cover the pie with a flat of puff-paste trimmings or with fine short-paste, proceeding as indicated, art. 537. Set the pie on a baking-sheet, bake it for one hour in a slack oven; cover it with a sheet of paper, as soon as the paste has taken color; when the pie is taken out ot the 0A7en, dish it up. 779. Roast woodcock, burgher’s way. The meat of the woodcock, as well as that of the pheasant, requires keeping a certain time, to get it tender; otherwise it is dry, and withoutDraw. 271.

Woodcocks must be kept till tender, by hanging up in a cool and airy place; they are plucked but a few hours previous to roasting them. This rule, by the bye, applies to all feathered game. Pluck two woodcocks, remove the crop, splitting the skin of the neck, then slightly singe them; truss them, piercing their legs with their own beak, wrap them up in bacon, pierce them slantwise with a small iron-skewer, which tix on a spit with both ends. Let the woodcocks roast at a good fire, place beneath them a dripping-pan, with a few slices of bread, baste the woodcocks with the aid of the paste-brush, dipped in butter, let them roast for twenty minutes ; salt, and take them off the spit, untruss them, serve them on the crusts of bread, spread on the bottom of a dish ; range the pieces of bacon on their breasts. — Snipes (bScassines) may be roasted, in the same manner, after the same method. 780. Roast thrushes, wrapped in bacon. Singe six thrushes, remove their crop, cross the paws behind, hook- ing them to the nether part of the beak ; wrap up each of them with a strip of bacon, file them on transversally to an iron-skewer, which fix to the spit; moisten the thrushes with a little butter, let them roast at a good fire, for twelve minutes, with some slices of bread, ranged under- neath them in the dripping-pan ; at the last moment, salt them, range the crusts on a dish, and the thrushes upon them. 781. Roast moorfowl. The waterhens, or moorfowl, which feed along the banks of streams of running water, constitute a very delicate game, just as appreciable362 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. as the snipe; but this is not the case, if these birds live in marshy places by putrid waters, as their meat then takes a fishy taste, that is very disagreeable. In the former case, the moorfowl is prepared like the wood- cock, that is, without drawing it, and with slices of bread underneath. If the waterfowl have taken some fishy taste, they must be drawn, and be stuffed with bread-stuffing, mixed with a little chopped onion and parsley; then they must be pierced with a skewer, and roasted on the spit for fifteen or eighteen minutes. 782. Teal (sarcelles or cercelles) with olives. Draw, and wash two or three teal {cercelles), spunge them interiorly with a cloth, put into the hollow of their body a bunch of parsley, and aromatics ; mask their breast with a strip of bacon, or an oiled sheet of paper 5 then pierce them through the side with an iron-skewer: fix the skewer then on the spit, let the teal roast at a brisk fire for fourteen or fifteen minutes ; when they are done, unwrap them, cut them up, dh iding each of them into four pieces, dish them, placing the fillets on the top, mask them with brown-sauce, mixed up with stoned and blanched olives.. 783. ‘Souffle’ of woodcocks with truffles. Prepare a woodcock-puree, proceeding as indicated toi paitiidge- puree. When it is passed through a sieve, add to it a little game-extract, prepared with the body-bones, thickened with a little sauce, and reduced to half-glaze; add to it besides seven or eight raw yolks of eggs, a piece of butter, four tablespoonfuls of truffles, boiled with a little madeira, and cut into small dice. Season the preparation, then introduce into it six whipped whites of eggs, pour it into a ‘souffle’-pan previously but- tered ; bake the ‘souffle’ in a slack oven for twenty-five or thirty minutes; when’taken out of the oven, set the pan on a dish, and serve it immediately. 784. ‘Chaufroix’ of thrushes. Bone ten or twelve thrushes ; season them inside, then till them with a game force-meat (art. 123) finished with truffles cut into small dice.GAME. — TEAL, WOODCOCKS, THRUSHES 363 Roll the thrushes to a round shape, surround them with a band of paper; range them, one beside the other, in a flat stewpan; salt them, moisten them, nearly to height, with a little gravy unskimmed ; let them braise at a very slow fire, or at the mouth of the oven, for twenty minutes; let them cool in their cooking-stock ; drain them, trim them ; take them, one by one, with a fork, dip them into a brown chaufroix-sauce ; (see art. 206) Draw. 273. range them on a baking-sheet; when the sauce has well cooled, trim them all round; range them in a pyramid, on a cold dish; surround them with jelly-‘croutons’. 785. Salmis of woodcocks, burgher’s way. Roast two woodcocks in the conditions prescribed, art. 779, with bread-crusts; when done, divide each of them into five pieces, which trim properly, remove their skin, and the greater part of their bones ; place them in a middling-sized stewpan with the two heads of the woodcocks; glaze them with the paste-brush, and keep them covered. Remove the intestines from the. bodies, pound and pass them through a sieve. Boil a gill and a half of brown-sauce, or thickened gravy, adding to it four tablespoonfuls of madeira, the body-bones and trimmings of woodcocks cut in pieces, some peppercorns, two shalots, and a bunch of aromatics; give this sauce a few minutes’ vigorous ebullition, then pass it through a sieve ; skim off its fat, and with it, gradually dilute the puree ; pour it over the cut woodcocks, in order to warm them, but free of ebullition. Trim the crusts, place them on the bottom of a warm dish; upon these crusts range the woodcocks in a group, with the heads all round them ; pour over the sauce.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 364 786. Salmis of thrushes. Roast seven or eight thrushes, without drawing them ; when they are done, divide each of them in two; trim each of these halves, range them in a stewpan, glaze them, and keep them in the ‘bain-marie’, reserv- ing the intestines. Put the trimmings into a stewpan with some aromatics, a little gravy and white wine ; cover the stewpan, give the liquid a few minutes’ ebullition, pass it then through a sieve. Pour into a stewpan a gill and a half of brown-sauce, let it reduce, stirring it, and gradually introducing into it the extract obtained from the trimmings ; when thickened to the degree requisite, pour it over the half-thrushes. — On the other hand, put into a frying-pan the intestines and livers of the thrushes, two or three poultry-livers, and some cut bacon ; season them, let them fry on a brisk tire; pound them, and pass them through a sieve; mix into this puree a little glaze, and with it mask eight or ten small bread-crusts, cut either in a round or oblong shape, and fried with butter; mind letting the preparation arch a little; glaze the puree with the paste-brush, keep the crusts at the entrance of the oven. — At serving-time, dish the halves ot thrushes, and mask them with the sauce; place the farced crusts all round the thrushes. 787. Cold-pie of snipes. Singe, and entirely bone ten snipes, stuff them, proceeding as indicated in the art. 784.

Butter a pie-mould of low shape ; line it with short-paste. Mask the bottom and sides of the paste-case, with a layer of force-meat: it should be thick on the bottom; upon this layer, range another of larks untrussed; fill the mould thus, alternating force-meat and game. Form a dome above the level of the rim ; cover this dome with, a round flat of paste, which solder at its sides ; cut both the flats, regularly pinch them. Deco- rate the dome with some small leaves imitated in paste; make a little aperture on the upper part of the pie, push it into the oven ; ten minutes after, cover it with paper, bake it thus for an hour and a half: it must be done at the moment of serving it; dish it up. Cern the dome, remove the top, pour into the interior two or three gills of brown-sauce, prepared with the body-bones of the larks; put the cover back on the pie, which serve.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 366 789. Lark-pie, in a dish. Cut off the paws, and the neck, of a score of singed larks ; remove the gizzard; put them into a frying-pan with some butter, and some thin slices of streaky-bacon, or ot ham ; season them, let them fry on a brisk fire for five or six minutes, drain them on a dish ; pour a little gravy into the pan; let it boil for two minutes, thicken it with a little sauce, or simply with some kneaded-butter, and pour it over the larks. Mask the bottom of a pie-dish with a few thin slices of beef or veal, season them, and on these arrange the larks; baste them with the sauce; when this is cooled, cover the pie, proceeding as directed, ait. 531. 790. Larks with rice. Pluck two dozen larks, singe them, draw them, put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter; let them fry quickly for seven or eight minutes ; then drain them on a dish, leaving the tat in the stewpan. Cut in dice six ounces of raw ham, put it into the stewpan contain- ing the fat, let them fry for a few moments, add to them two glassiuls ot rice picked, but not washed; a few moments after, moisten the rice with four or five tablespoonfuls of broth, let the liquid boil; five minutes after, add to it the larks, a little pinch of powder-pimento, a small bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, and two tomatas peeled, treed ot their seed, and chopped; cover the stewpan, remove it back to the side ot the fire; when the rice is done, dish it up with the larks, having removed the bunch. 791. Roast quails. Singe six quails, draw them, put their livers back into the body, pieice them near the legs with a small skewer, alternating each of them with a small slice of bread cut off the crumb ; fix the skewer on a spit by both its ends ; butter the quails with the paste-brush, let them roast at a good fire, basting them : ten minutes will do ; salt them, take them off the spit, serve them on a hot dish ; pour over them the fat of the dnppmg-pan, and surround them with cut lemons.367 GAME. — LARKS, QUAILS. 792.

Quails in ‘macedoine’. Draw, and singe seven or eight quails ; season the livers, mix them with a little chopped bacon, put them back into the quails’ body ; truss them, range them side by side on the bottom of a stewpan, spread with the remains of bacon, ham, and some minced vegetables ; add to them a bunch ot parsley, garnished with aromatics, slightly salt the quails, then moisten them nearly to height with broth and white wine ; cover them with a buttered paper ; let the liquid reduce to half, then remove the stewpan back on a slow lire ; finish braising the quails quite gently ; at serving-time, drain them, untruss, and glaze them with the paste-brush; pass their cooking-stock through a sieve, mix it up with a little ‘bechamel’- sauce; let the sauce reduce, until it be thickened to the degree requisite, and succulent; then add to it a little ‘macedoine’ of vegetables of the season, as varied as possible (see art. 77); pour the ‘macedoine’ on a deep dish, and place the quails, in a rosette, on the vegetables.EGGS, FRITTERS, VEGETABLES. Eggs and fritters are often served for luncheon; but they are served likewise in a dinner, either at the same time with the vegetables, or instead of them. O' Draw. 276. Draw. 277. Vegetables are served in a dinner generally after the roasts. But a great part of the vegetables, which are served as entre- mets, may also be served as garnish to an entree 01 lemove. Now that vegetables can be preserved, by proceedings, which do not sensibly alter their qualities, a great many vegetables can even in winter-time be used in the kitchen, which foimeily could only be procured in the season producing them; such are: green-pease, kidney-beans, asparagus, tomatas, artichokes, Spanish artichokes (cordons), celery, truffles, etc. With so great resources it is possible at any place, and any season, to serve a selection of choice vegetables more specially adapted to various dinners. This is a considerable advantage, from which the kitchen derives the greatest benefit.EGGS. - FARCED, FRIED, MIXED, GRATINATED. 369 794. Farced eggs. Loil hard ten eggs, cut each ot them in two lengthwise; separate the whites from the yolks, which chop ; also chop in equal parts, but not too tine, some cooked mushrooms, pickled tongue, and cooked poultry- meat, or veal-fillets; mix this meat up with the chopped yolks into a kitchen-basin; season the preparation, thicken it with a few spoonfuls °f.good 1 bechamel’-sauce, so as to keep it of a nice consistence. W ith this preparation fill the hollow of the halves of eggs, smoothe it, .giung the halves ot eggs the shape of a whole egg; let them cool well, then roll them in bread-crumb; dip them into beaten eggs, and bread- crumb them again. — At serving-time, plunge the eggs into plenty of hot frying-fat; when they have taken a nice color, drain them, dish them up in a group, on a folded napkin. 795. Eggs, with onions.

Eggs boiled soft, and hard. Eggs can only be boiled soft, if they are quite fresh, new-laid; nothing being more disagreeable, and injurious to the health, than an egg which is not of perfect freshness. Place the eggs carefully in a stewpan of cold water, which cover; let the liquid boil, immediately remove it off the firefive minutes after, drain the eggs. — If the eggs are plunged into boiling water, one must give them three minutes or three minutes and a half, according to then- size ; the chief point is, not to break them in plunging them in. Boiled eggs’are served, wrapt up in a folded napkin; but they may also be served in a dish imitating a hen hatching her eggs. — In order to boil the eggs hard, it is sufficient to boil them for ten minutes, then plunge them into cold water, and not to drain them till a quarter of an hour after, m order to remove their shell. 803. Poached eggs. Just us eggs for boiling soft must be of extreme freshness, that is, new-laid the very day; even so is it the same for poached eggs, which can be good only on this condition. Let some water boil in a middling-sized stewpan; salt it, add to it a drop of vinegar, remove it back on the side of the fire, so that it boils on one side only ; then break six eggs one after the other, opening tiein just above the water, and letting them drop in, right on the place that is in ebullition. As soon as the eggs, are set, take the stewpan off the fire just enough to let the ebullition cease; three minutes after, take it ott entirely; take the eggs now carefully up with aid of a skimmer touch them with the finger, in order to ascertain if the cover be of sufficient resistance; if this be the case, plunge them into a vessel of cold water, a quarter of an hour later, trim them carefully, and serve. Eggs are also poached in their shell; to attain this result they must be plunged into boiling water, and boiled for lour and a half oi v minutes! according to their size; then drain, and plunge them into cold water; ten or twelve minutes after, carefully remo\ e t ion s le373 EGGS. — BOILED, POACHED, &c. it is time to serve the eggs, plunge them into warm water, immediately remove them, and serve. — Poached eggs may be served with a garnish of sorrel, or endive, a puree of poultry, or game, or even with tomata- sauce. 804. Omelet with fine-herbs* The drawing, accompanying this article, is the exact representation of an omelet folded in ‘porte-manteau’; many cooks prepare omelets, but only a few know how to give them a nice shape, so rendering them pleasant to the eye. The omelet with fine-herbs, and generally all the Draw. 278. folded omelets, must be of a very smooth surface, and remain creamy within. Break * eight or ten eggs into a kitchen-basin, season them with salt and pepper, add to them a large pinch of parsley, gathered fresh and chopped, then a pinch of chives, and another of chervil: the bottom of the basin may be rubbed with half a clove of garlic. Vigorously beat the eggs with a fork. Put three ounces of good butter into an omelet-pan,** kept quite clean; set the pan on the fire, which must be brisk; when the butter is warm, add to it the beaten eggs ; stir this preparation with a spoon, in order to thicken it, without allowing it to get dry; as soon as it sets, turn the pan round, in order to disengage the omelet from the bottom; immediately gather it to one side of the pan, and fold it up, bringing back to the centre both its extremities; pour into the pan a tablespoonful of melted butter, then turn the omelet In breaking an egg, as soon as the shell is broken, and previous to dropjung it, it should be tested by the smell, in order to ascertain, that it has no ill odor. Omelet-pans may on no account serve for any other purpose ; they must not be washed, but simply be well rubbed and wiped.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 374 out on a small oblong dish; fold back both the ends to the inside, in order to give it a nice shape; serve it immediately. 805. Poached eggs, on anchovy-crusts. Poach some fresh eggs, one shells, taking care to keep them quite round. — Cut into oval shape several slices of household-bread, a fifth of an inch thick; let them fry in butter to a nice color. At serving-time, mask them on one side with a thick layer of anchovy-butter; range them on a dish, and set a poached egg upon each of them. 806. Poached eggs, with cream. Plunge eight eggs into warm water, whole, without breaking them; let the water boil for iivc minutes, keeping the stewpan covered; this done, drain them, plunge them into cold water, and let them completely cool ; then remove the shell, breaking it gradually. Warm the eggs in warm water for a few moments, drain them, dish them up, mask them with a reduced ‘bechamel’-sauce, finished with a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, and a piece ot butter. In order to have these eggs just boiled to the degree requisite, they must maintain themselves well in shape, while the yolk is liquid in the interior. These soft eggs may be served as a garnish. .807. Omelet with potatoes. Take some raw potatoes, which turn to the shape of corkscrews, cut off both their extremities, chop them into thin slices ; put these slices into a pan with butter, season them, let them toss on a moderate fire, until they are done, and have taken a fine color; then drain them on a sieve. Break into a kitchen-basin ten fresh eggs, season them, mix into them a pinch of chopped parsley, and beat them up quickly. — Let melt in an omelet-pan a quarter of a pound of butter ; when it is warm, pour the beaten eggs, as well as the potatoes, into the pan; spread the potatoes over all the surface of the pan, and with the prongs of a fork prick t e omelet all over, in order to make the liquid parts slip underneath; as soon as the eggs are set, turn the pan round, in order to disengageOMELET. — WITH FINE-HERBS, POTATOES, NEW ONIONS. 375 the omelet from the bottom of the pan.

Mince six comestible mushrooms, fresh, and well cleansed; put them into the pan, wherein the artichokes have been, let them fry at a brisk fire, until their moisture be reduced; this done, remove the pan off the fire, mix the artichokes up with the mushrooms, add to them a pinch of chives, another of taragon-leaves, another of parsley, all of which chopped together. — Rub the bottom of a kitchen-basin with a cut clove of garlic; break into this basin ten very fresh eggs, season them, beat them up vigorously for a few moments. — Let a quarter of a pound of butter melt in an omelet-pan; when the butter is quite hot, mix into it the beaten eggs ; thicken the omelet, gather it at the side of the pan ; spread then on its centre the artichokes and mushrooms; fold it up, turn it out on a dish; mask the bottom of this dish with a little tomata-sauce.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKEliY-BOOK. 370 810. Omelet with crusts. Break ten eggs into a basin, season them, add to them a pinch of grated parmesan, beat them up quickly for a few moments. — Cut into small dice a piece of household bread-crumb; put them into a colander, in order to sift through the fine crumbs, let the dice fry in a pan with butter ; when they have taken a nice color, drain them on a sieve. Melt in an omelet-pan three ounces of butter; as soon as it is warm, pour the eggs into the pan, adding to them the bread-crusts; thicken the omelet, fold it up, turn it out on a dish. 811. Omelet with mushrooms. Mince some fresh, well cleansed, good hot-bed mushrooms ; put them into a thin stewpan with either oil or butter, season them, let them fry on a brisk fire, until their moisture be reduced; add to them a pinch of chopped parsley, immediately take them off the fire. — Rub the bottom and sides of a kitchen-basin, with half a clove of garlic ; break into this basin ten fresh eggs, season them, add to them a pinch of chopped parsley and chives. — Pour a quarter of a pound of butter melted into an omelet-pan, let it warm, add then to it the beaten eggs ; thicken the omelot, spread on its centre the mushroom-preparation, immediately fold it up, turn it out on a small oval dish. 812.

Trim and mince a good raw veal-kidney; cut it up in fine slices, not too large; put them into a frying-pan with a piece of butter, season them,OMELET, WITH CRUSTS, MUSHROOMS, HAM, KIDNEYS, SORREL. 377 let them fry on a brisk fire; as soon as they arc set to the degree requisite, drain the moisture, pour over them a little melted glaze, sprinkle over a little chopped parsley. On the other hand, break into a kitchen-basin ten fresh eggs, season them, add to them a pinch of chives, beat them up quickly. — Pour three ounces of melted butter into an omelet-pan, and when it is well warmed, mix up with it the beaten eggs ; thicken the omelet, gather it to the rim of the pan, opposite to the side with the handle ; turn the slices out on the centre of the omelet; which fold up, and turn over on a dish. 814. Omelet with sorrel. This is an omelet most commonly partaken of in spring-time, the sorrel then being tender. Melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, add to it four tablespoonfuls of sorrel-puree ; season it with a little salt, and a pinch of sugar; let it fry, stirring it, until its moisture be reduced ; thicken it then with two spoon- fuls of reduced ‘bechamel’-sauce; boil it for five minutes, without leaving it, then take it off the fire. — Break ten fresh eggs into a kitchen-basin, season them with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; add to them two or three spoonfuls of cream, beat them up quickly. — Melt a quarter of a pound of butter in an omelet-pan; when it is well heated, add to it the beaten eggs; immediately thicken the omelet, place the sorrel on its centre, fold it up, turn it out on a small oblong dish. 815. Macaroni with gravy. Before boiling the macaroni, prepare a little good succulent veal- gravy, skim off only part of the fat; mix with it some spoonfuls of tomata-sauce, a small bunch of aromatics, a few grains of pepper, and a little raw ham; let it simmer by the side of the fire. The macaroni of Naples is that to be preferred, for it is superior to all that is manufactured elsewhere, especially when it is fresh. There are several species of macaroni; the large, the middling - sized, and the small; all three sorts may be prepared with gravy.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 378 The macaroni must, first of all, be boiled in salted water, till it lias attained the degree requisite ; lovers of macaroni eat it rather under- done, and they are right; for if it is eaten too much done, it is not so good, and far more difficult of digestion ; but this is a question of taste and preference. The macaroni takes more or less time to cook, accord- ing to the length of time since it was made; to secure its being rightly done, it must be tried from time to time, that is, by taking a little morsel between the teeth; as soon as it has ceased cracking, it is ready to be served. As soon as the macaroni is done, drain it in a colander, but without letting it cool; then take it up in small portions with a skimmer, range it by alternate layers in a deep dish, sprinkling each layer with a handful of good, fresh, scraped parmesan, and moistening them with a part of the prepared gravy, passed through a sieve, mixed with a little good butter. If the gravy should be thin, it would be requisite to mix with it a little good meat-glaze, melted. Macaroni with gravy, ought to be eaten quite hot. 816. Macaroni, ‘a la hussarde’. Boil in salted water a pound of little macaroni, drain them well, then put them back into the same stewpan again, introduce into them four ounces of butter, and three ounces of parmesan 5 then mix into this a pinch of cayenne-pepper, two spoonfuls of ‘bechamel-sauce, four spoon- fuls of melted glaze, and four peeled cooked truffles, shred to ‘julienne’; range the macaroni on a warm dish, sprinkle over a handful ot grated parmesan^ moisten it with a little tomata-sauce. 817.

Prepare a ‘bechamel’-sauce, with two tablespoonfuls of flour, six gills of milk, and a little salt; as soon as it is thickened, remove it back to the side of the fire, let it boil thus for a quarter of an hour; pass it, through a sieve, into a flat stewpan, let it reduce without leaving it, introducing into it a little good cream; when it has got a nice consistence, take it off the fire, pour it into a kitchen-basin, stir it with a spoon, till it be nearly cold ; then mix up with it a handful of grated parmesan, a little nutmeg, a pinch of sugar, apiece of butter,THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 380 and five or six raw yolks of eggs ; the yolks must be introduced one by one, working the preparation vigorously ; at this point, incorporate with it, gradually, four whipped whites of eggs ; introduce, at the same time with the whites of eggs, two handfuls of grated parmesan. When the mixture is operated, pour the preparation into a buttered ‘souffle’-pan, bake it for fifteen minutes in a very slack oven, or else in the field-oven. Here is the second method : Let boil three gills of good milk, take it off the fire, introduce into it, gradually, with the aid of a spoon, two handfuls of grated fresh bread-crumb, so as to get a batter of not too great consistence; add to it a little salt, a pinch of sugar, and a little nutmeg; put the stewpan back on the fire, boil the preparation for a few minutes without leaving it; take it off the fire, let it nearly cool, stirring it; then introduce into it a piece of butter, six yolks of eggs, and last of all, four or five whipped whites, and cheese, operating as has just been said. 819. Cheese-tartlets. With the trimmings of puff-paste rolled out thin, line two dozen tartlet - moulds of a round or oval shape. — Put into a stewpan one tablespoonful of flour, four tablespoonfuls of grated parmesan, and six yolks of eggs; add to this two ounces of butter, and a pinch of sugar. Stir this preparation on a slow fire till the butter be dissolved, then take it off the fire, let it cool, introduce into it four whipped whites of eggs. With this preparation fill the moulds, range them on a baking- sheet, bake the cakes in a slack oven; when they are taken out, sprinkle over grated parmesan, and serve them without delay. 820. Talmouses, with cheese. Prepare four eggs of choux-paste (see sweetmeats), without sugar or zest, keeping it a little stiffer than is usually done; mix up with it four tablespoonfuls of gruyere-cheese, cut in little dice, and a pinch ot pepper or nutmeg. — Roll out nine ounces of puff-paste, divide it in rounds, by the aid of a large channeled paste-cutter; slightly moisten the edges of each of these flats, then set on their centre a small part ot the choux-paste; round this paste; egg it, then fold over the edges of381 CHEESE-TARTLETS, TALMOUSES, RAVIOLES. the puff-paste flat, on three sides, so as to obtain a kind of tricorn • sprinkle over a pinch of grated parmesan, range them on a baking-sheet at little distances from one another, bake them in a slack oven for twenty minutes, and serve them immediately. 821. Ravioles with parmesan. ‘Ravioles’ are prepared with ‘nouille’-paste, and force-meat; this force-meat is prepared thus: pound together eight ounces of cooked Draw- 280‘ Draw. 281. lowl, and a piece of cooked lean ham; add the fourth part of a calf’s brains, and two yolks of eggs; pass the force-meat through a sieve, put it into a kitchen - basin, mix with it a little nutmeg, and a handful of scraped parmesan. Prepare twelve or thirteen ounces of ‘nouille’-paste, divide it into tvo paits ; flatten out very thin one of these halves, giving it the shape of an oblong square ; out of this flat, by the aid of a small spoon, or of a bag (pocke), arrange in straight rows a number of little balls of force- meat, of equal size, at intervals from one another (see draw. 280). When the surface of the flat is garnished, wet the paste on the intervals, with the paste-brush ; then cover this flat with another flat in paste of the same dimensions; press the paste down between the lines, in order to solder the two flats together; cut the paste then all round the sides, and then cut out the ‘ravioles' by the aid of a pastry-wheel, slipping this, between the lines, but down the length, and across, so as to get tin ee ravioles of a square form (see draw. 281); range these ravioles’on leaves of paper, and cover them, that the paste may not get dry.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 382 A few minutes before serving, plunge the ‘ravioles’ into boiling water, salted ; boil them for two minutes; then remove the stew pan to the side, keep it thus for four or five minutes, then drain the havioles’ with a skimmer, and range them, one by one, in layers, in a deep dish, sprinkling each layer with scraped parmcsan, moisten them with a little good gravy, thickened with tomata-sauce, moisten them also with a little brown-butter (‘a la noisette’), and serve them immediately. 822. Rice-quisclie. Prepare a flat of short-paste (with a pound of flour, five ounces of butter, and two yolks) ; with this flat, line an iron baking-sheet; distri- bute a few little bits of butter on the surface of the paste. On the other hand, boil in milk four ounces of rice; it must be melted into batter, finish it with a little cream • at last introduce into it three ounces of butter, and three or four whole eggs ; add to it a pinch of nutmeg, and a little pinch of sugar ; spread it, in a thin layer, on the paste ; sprinkle over a little grated parmesan ; push the baking-sheet into the oven. When the paste is done, take the ‘quische’ out, and serve it. 823. ‘Ravioles’ with spinach. Chop some blanched spinach, well pressed out; let it fry with butter, then sprinkle over a little flour, season it, and moisten it with a little milk, keeping it rather consistent. Let the preparation cool, and with it prepare a few dozen havioles’, proceeding according to the method prescribed in art. 821. — Ten minutes previous to serving, plunge the ‘ravioles’ into boiling salted water; boil them for three minutes, drain them on a sieve, place them on a deep dish, ranging layer by layer, sprinkling over some grated parmesan, and moistening them with brown- butter mixed up with a little tomata-sauce. 824. Small patties, for Lent. Prepare fifteen little patties with puff-paste (see art. 54, and 335); when they are taken out of the oven, disengage them from the baking-sheet,883 QUISCHE, LENT-PATTIES, NOUILLES, CROQUETTES, RISOT. empty them, and keep them warm. — Break into a basin fifteen or sixteen fresh eggs, season them with salt and a pinch of nutmeg; beat them up quickly for a few minutes. Peel three raw truffles, cut them into small dice, which place in a stewpan with butter; season, and let them warm ; then add to them the beaten eggs, as well as a piece of butter divided in little bits; stir the preparation, with a spoon, on the fire, until Draw. 282. it be thickened; mix up with it a few tablespoonfuls of cream or ‘bechamel’- sauce; take it off the fire; fill the patties, place their cover on their top, and dish them up. 825. ‘Nouilles’, with parmesan. Prepare some ‘nouille’- paste with twelve ounces of flour, five whole eggs, a little salt, and a little tepid water; keep the paste stiff, let it rest for ten minutes; divide it then into two or three parts, which roll out, one after the other, to the shape of a thin square (using the rolling- pin) ; largely sprinkle over the paste some fine flour, fold the paste up several times, then cut it up into fine strings. — Seven or eight minutes previous to serving, plunge the ‘nouilles’ into a stewpan of boiling water, salted but a little; give the liquid three minutes’ vigorous ebullition, then drain the ‘nouilles’ on a sieve without refreshing them ; pour them into a saute-pan, introduce into them (off the fire, and with the aid of a fork) six ounces of fresh butter divided in little bits, and at the same time tour ounces of grated parmesan ; serve them in a deep dish, pour over them some good beef-gravy, mixed with a little tomata-sauce. 826. ‘Nouilles’-croquettes. Boil a pound, and a quarter, of minced ‘nouilles’ (see art. 825); drain them quickly, place them in a stewpan, season them, introduce into them half a pound of butter, then three or four handfuls of grated parmesan; thicken this preparation with two spoonfuls of reduced ‘bechamel’-sauce, immediately pour it into a small buttered baking-sheet of square shape, smoothe its upper surface, give it the thickness of two thirds of an inch, or of one inch ; cover it ivitli a sheet384 TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. of buttered paper, let it cool; then divide it into squares about two inches long; roll these squares in grated parmesan, dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them ; fry them in plenty of hot frying-fat; let them take a fine color, drain, and dish them up in a group. 827. Risot with parmesan. Chop an onion fine, put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter, or of beef-marrow chopped, and melted; stir it with a wooden spoon, till it is slightly colored ; then add a pound of best rice, rubbed, but not washed; let it fry for a few seconds ; moisten it to three times its height with broth, cover the pan, boil the rice at a good fire, on a low trevet, so that it may not adhere to the bottom of the pan; fifteen to sixteen minutes’ ebullition will suffice : at this point, the rice ought to be still firm, but well done, and no longer crackling between the teeth: it ought to be about dry; withdraw then die pan from the fire, keeping it covered for five minutes : then incorporate with the rice two handfuls of fresh scraped parmesan, as well as four or five ounces of good butter, divided into little bits; range the risot in a deep dish, moisten it with a little melted glaze; send up separately a plate of scraped parmesan. 828. Dumplings (kloese), with bread. Cut into dice the white crumb of six or eight dinner-rolls; put it into a kitchen-basin, pour some boiling milk over, and leave it to soak; a quarter of an hour after, extract all the moisture, place it in a stewpan, bray with a spoon, and heat it in order to thicken it; then remove it off the fire, season, and introduce into it five ounces of butter in little bits, three or four eggs, two handfuls of small fried bread- crusts, in dice, and six ounces of streaky-bacon, also cut into small dice and fried: the preparation should be compact enough to be divided into small parts, which roll on a floured table. A little previous to serving, plunge the dumplings into salted boiling water, boil the liquid for seven or eight minutes (keeping the stewpan covered), then remove it back. Eight or ten minutes after, drain the dumplings, dish them up, and pour over some brown clarified butter.385 KISOT, KLOESE, GNOQUIS, NOQUES. 829. ‘Gnoquis’ of potatoes.

Swiss gnoquis. Prepare some choux-paste (see sweetmeat) with a glassful of milk the same of flour, four ounces and a half of butter; as soon as the paste' has dried to the degree requisite, take it off the fire, and put it into another stewpan; season it with a little salt, and a pinch of sugar- gradually introduce into it two whole eggs, and three yolks of eggs' then finish it with a handful of grated parmesan. Now divide the paste into two or three parts, which place on the floured slab, and roll up to thick strings; let them poach in salted water, till they have o-ot rm ; dram them, dip these pieces in melted butter, roll them in grated parmesan, range them in a vegetable stewpan, and let them gratinate m the oven for twenty minutes. 831. Noques, with butter. Put into a kitchen-basin two large handfuls of white bread-crumb moisten it with milk, let it soak for full a quarter of an hour ; then press’ out its moisture, and bruise it with a spoon. On the other hand, pour into a basin six ounces of butter half- melted, work it with a spoon till it be thickened and creamy ; then add to It seven or eight yolks of eggs, introducing them one by one ; when it is frothy, mix into it the bread-crumb, and a pinch of flour • season386 TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. the preparation with salt and nutmeg, try a little portion of it; when it is at the degree requisite, take it up with a tablespoon, let it drop into boiling salted water; let the water boil, immediately remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire ; cover it, and keep thus for ten or twelve minutes. The ‘noques’ must then be firm and set; drain them, dish them up, mask them with a sauce, composed of bread - crumb fried with butter until dry. 832. Black truffles with wine. Choose a few fresh black truffles, being rather firm ; put them into water, carefully brush them, pluck them with the point of a knife, removing any particles of earth, that could have remained in their cavities. — In such conditions the truffles may be boiled with their peel on; if this be the case, put the truffles into a stewpan; moisten them to a third their height with dry white-wine, a little salt, and a bunch of parsley and aromatics ; cover the stewpan, and boil the truffles on a brisk fire, for eight or ten minutes, according to their size; take thein off the fire, glaze them with the paste-brush, serve them, dry, in a deep vegetable-dish, covered with its lid; serve at the same time some iresh butter. — If the truffles are boiled with the peel on, five minutes will do. Peeled truffles generally are served as a garnish. 833. Truffles with ‘montglas’. Mince into montglas (see art. 40) the white-meat of a cooked chicken, put it into a stewpan, thicken it with some spoonfuls of white- sauce, reduced and well warmed ; keep the stewpan in the Tain-marie’. Choose five or six middling-sized raw truffles of an equal size; peel them, mince them to ‘montglas’, put them into a stewpan ; moisten them with a quarter of a glassful of madeira-wine; let the liquid reduce on a brisk fire. Thicken the truffles then with a little melted glaze, add to them a piece of butter, divided into little bits, and the juice of a lemon; dish up the chicken-meat, form a hollow in its centre, into this hollow put the truffles.TRUFFLES, MORTLS, MUSHROOMS. 3g7 834. Truffles, Italian way. Take six large raw well cleansed truffles already plucked ; mince them? put them into a frying-pan with oil, and butter ; season them, add to them a clove of garlic; let them fry on a slow fire, tossing them; when they are well warmed, moisten them with half a glassful of madeira-wine, and a little melted glaze; boil them for three or four minutes, then take them off the fire ; thicken the liquid with a little kneaded-butter, and at the same time a little bit of anchovy-butter; give the sauce but one bubbling up; remove the garlic, adding a pinch of chopped parsley. Pour the stew on a dish, surrounding it with bread- crusts fried with butter. 835. Crusts with truffles. Cut off a household-loaf some slices of the thickness of about two thirds of an inch ; out of these slices cut then seven or eight crusts in the shape of a semi-heart, round on one side, and pointed on the other; cern them with the point of a small knife, on one surface only, in order to mark the aperture; let them fry with butter in a flat stewpan, open them, empty them, and keep them warm. — Cut in small dice, seven or eight raw and plucked truffles ; place them in a stewpan with butter, season them- warm them on a brisk fire, moisten them with four tablespoonfuls of madeira-wine, and the same of melted glaze; let the liquid reduce to half; immediately take it off the fire, thicken it with a little consistent sauce, finish the stew with a piece of good butter, and with it fill the crusts. Draw. 283. 836. Morils with butter. Choose fresh and good morils, trim the end of the stems, split the buttons crossways in order to wash them well; plunge them into soiling, and acidulated water, immediately drain them; then put them into a stewpan with butter, and the juice of a lemon; cover them, let the liquid boil till it be completely reduced ; at this degree the morils s oidd prove done. — Morils prepared thus may be served with any sauce whatever, and are served either as a garnish, or as a vegetable.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 388 837. Crust with mushrooms. Choose two dozen fresh, very firm, and not too large hot-bed mushrooms; separate the stems or feet, from the heads, or buttons, which wash quickly and spunge carefully ; put them into a stewpan with butter, season them, let them fry, till all their moisture be gradually evaporated; pour over them a little white-sauce, and remove them back on a slow lire. — Take a round one-pound loaf of bread; cut it at its base, in order to remove the bottom-crust, and then the crumb of the interior ; grate then the exterior crust; whereupon butter its inside, as well as outside, with the aid of a paste-brush ; place it on a gridiron, and let it dry in the oven ; then place it on a dish with its hollow part uppermost. Finish the mushrooms with a liaison of two or three yolks of eggs, diluted with a little cream ; add to them a piece of butter, and the juice of a lemon ; pour it into the crust. 838. Shells with cepes (mushrooms).* Choose small, but very firm cepes, mince their heads, put them into a frying-pan with a little butter, let them fry quite gently, toss them repeatedly; season them, add to them a garnished bunch; as soon as their moisture is reduced, thicken them with some spoonfuls of good ‘becha- mel’-sauce of a nice consistence. With this stew till some table-shells, smoothe their surface, sprinkle over a little bread-crumb, glaze it with the salamander ; dish the shells up on a folded napkin. 839. Potato-quenelles. Let the potatoes boil with their peel on; then peel them, grate them, or else pass them through a sieve ; take then a pound of this puree, put it into a stewpan, introduce into it three ounces ol butter, a handful of grated parmesan, four yolks of eggs, and one whole egg; season it with salt, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar ; pour the paste on the Homed slab, work it with the hands, introducing into it six ounces of flour; * A species of mushroom, called cepes, in France, gribouis in Russia, where they abound.C&PES, POTATOES, QUENELLES, PUKpE. 339 try then a little piece of this paste by plunging it into boiling water: if it is at the degree requisite, roll it up in strings, which divide in little pieces; roll these pieces to a long shape, let them poach in boiling water; when they have got firm, drain them, place them, by layers, on a deep dish, pouring over each layer a little bread-crumb, fried with butter, or else seasoned with melted butter, and grated parmesan. 840. Potato-puree. Peel some good potatoes raw, cut them up in pieces, wash them, moisten them to cover with water; salt them, let them boil on a brisk fire, keeping the stewpan covered; drain the water, as soon as they are nearly done, and remove them back; cover them, keep them in the hot-closet for ten minutes, then pass them through a sieve; put this puree into a stewpan with a piece of butter, some salt, and nutmeg; warm it, stilling it, and adding to it some spoonfuls of good raw cream. 841. Dauphiness-potatoes. Prepare some potato-puree, place it in a stewpan, season it with salt, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar ; gradually introduce into it a third its volumojpf choux’-paste, finished, but not sweetened at all; now take the preparation in parts of the size of an egg, roll them on the floured slab, giving them a half-flat shape, or the form of a cor^ j plunge t[iem into hot frying-fat; as soon as they have taken a nice cmor, drain them on a cloth. 842. Housekeeper’s potatoes. Peel potatoes already boiled, but nearly cooled ; cut them up in large dice, put them into a stewpan with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a piece of butter; moisten them, just to height, with broth, boil them keeping the stewpan covered, till the liquid be nearly reduced; they should then prove tender, and the liquid slightly thickened; take them off the fire, add to them a piece of good butter, a pinch of chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon; serve them, as soon as the butter is dissolved.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 390 843. Lyonnaise potatoes. Boil the potatoes with their peel on; then drain them, and peel them, without allowing them to cool; turn them into the shape of corks, cut both the extremities, and mince them in slices. Chop an onion, let it fry in a frying-pan with butter ; add to it the minced potatoes, let them toss on a slow tire, season them with salt and pepper, finish them with a little chopped parsley. 844. Fried potatoes. Choose some good potatoes ; cut them in slices either lengthwise or transversally, plunge them into plenty of hot frying-fat, let them fry, stirring them with the skimmer, till they have taken a nice color, and have well set; drain them, salt, and dish them up in a group. — Potatoes are also fried, cut into little balls with the aid of a vegetable-spoon. These potatoes can be served as a garnish. 845. Farced potatoes. Choose a dozen large, mealy potatoes ; range them on a baking- sheet, bake them in a slack oven for full an hour; when they are taken out (being well set), choose seven or eight of them, having remained Avhole, and cern them on the top in order to contrive a roun£ aperture; by this aperture remove the interior pulp, which put into a stewpan, bruise it with a wooden spoon ; add to it three ounces of good butter, a little salt, a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of sugar, three yolks of eggs, and two spoonfuls of grated parmesan. — With this preparation fill the potatoes kept warm ; shut the aperture, with the cover kept by tor that purpose ; moisten them with a little melted butter, and bring them back into the oven; five minutes after, serve them. 846. Border of potatoes. Prepare some potato-puree (art. 840), put it into a stewpan, mix with it a piece of butter, a little cream, some yolks of eggs, a handful of grated parmesan, a little nutmeg; pour it out into a buttered, and ' floured mould; bake the border in a slack oven, or else let it poach in the ‘bain-marie’. — These potato-borders may be served with a garnishPOTATOES, FARCED, WITH CHEESE ; SALAD, COLD & HOT. 391 of vegetables in the centre, but they are often used also for dishing hot entrees. 847. Potatoes with cheese. Peel some raw potatoes, trim them to an equal size, cut them up in thin slices. Butter largely a vegetable-dish, and in this range the slices of potato, in layers, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper, and sprinkling them over with grated parmesan ; sprinkle over the top also, moisten it 'with a little butter, pour into the bottom of the dish two dessertspoonfuls of broth; let the potatoes gratinate at a slack oven, serve them as soon as they are done, and of a nice color. 848. Macedoine of vegetables in salad. This salad is composed of carrots, french-beans, green-pease, white and green heads of asparagus, cauliflower, kidney-beans, lentils, pre- served mushrooms (in vinegar), potatoes, gerkins, and beetroots. The smaller vegetables remain whole, the larger ones are cut in dice, or else in lozenges ; they are boiled, or blanched, according to their nature, and seasoned separately with salt, oil, and vinegar. The vegetables are then drained on a sieve, placed in a salad-dish, with as much taste, and elegance as possible ; then is poured over a Vinaigrette’, mixed with tine-herbs, and yolks of eggs boiled hard, and pounded. 849. Haricot-beans. In order to prepare haricot-beans {haricots - Manes), very good water is requisite : hard water is always bad for boiling dry vegetables. Wash the beans in tepid water, plunge them also into tepid water, boil them quite gently, salt them as soon as they are nearly done. — When the haricots are boiled, and drained, they can be eaten as a hot salad, V la maitre d’hotel7, with cream, with gravy, and ‘a la Lyonnaise’. In order to prepare them V la maitre-d’hoter, it is sufficient to put them into a stewpan with a piece of kneaded-butter, toss them for a few minutes, season them, take them off the fire, and finish them thus, intro- ducing into them a large piece of fresh butter divided in little bits, a pinch of chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 392 To prepare haricots with gravy, it is sufficient to pour over them a little good gravy ; thus let them simmer for a quarter of an hour, finish them, introducing into them a piece of butter. — To prepare them with cream, the gravy is replaced by Techamel’-sauce. The haricots may simply be sauted with butter; season them, and finish them with chopped parsley ; but they may also be fried with butter, and a little chopped onion, wherewith to saute the beans : this is the manner called ‘a la Lyonnaise’. 850. Kidney-beans. Kidney-beans or broad-beans, {flageolets), are fresh haricots, shelled (en grains) out of the pod; the beans are boiled in salted water, and served simply with butter, or thickened with a little white-sauce, then finished with the juice of a lemon, and a piece of butter. — Preserved kidney-beans are to be bought in the shops. 851. Boiled french-beans. If the french-beans ([haricots-verts) are fine and tender, they must be boiled rather whole than sliced, being much better thus; if they are large, then they must be shred, or sliced. — Refresh the french-beans, plunge them into salted water in a red vessel; boil them quickly, keeping them rather firm; drain them well, dish them up, serve at the same time a plate of good fresh butter. — French-beans boiled in salted water, can be served either as a garnish, or as a vegetable, with butter, or as salad. 852. Violet asparagus, butter-sauce. Cut the asparagus to equal lengths, having scalded, and scraped them; tie them together in little bundles, keep them in cold water till the moment of plunging them into boiling salted water; the asparagus must be boiled to exactly the degree, when they no longer crackle between the teeth, yet being still firm enough to remain upright, when taken by the stalks with the fingers. Drain them, range them on a folded napkin ; serve separately some butter-sauce. — These asparagus can be served, either with Dutch-sauce, or vinaigrette-sauce.393 VEGETABLES. — BEANS, ASPARAGUS, PEASE. 853. Green asparagus. Take two or three bundles of green asparagus ; break off the stems, put aside all the tender parts, cut them in pieces, a third of an inch long; boil the heads, and the stalks, in salted water, in two different red sugar-pans; keep them green, and not over-done ; drain them, put them into a flat stewpan with butter, let them fry for a few minutes, tossing them 5 season, and add to them a pinch of sugar, thicken them with a little white-sauce, dish them up. — These aspargus may be garnished, either with tried crusts, or else with poached eggs. 854. Green-pease, Flemish way. Choose a pint ot fresh, tender, but large green-pease ; plunge them into boiling salted water; add to them a score of small new potatoes properly cleansed ; one onion, and a bunch of parsley or mint. Cover the stewpan, boil the vegetables thus on a slow fire: the potatoes and gieen-pease should be done at the same time ; drain them, dish them up, pour o\er them a little melted butter. — Serve at the same time fresh butter on a plate. 855. Green-pease, ‘a la bourgeoise’. Chop a little onion, let it fry with butter, without however allowing it to take color 5 then add to this two handfuls of streaky - bacon cut in dice ; add to these a quart of green-pease, the hearts of three or four fresh lettuces, cut in squares, and a bunch of parsley; cover the stewpan, remove it back on a slow fire ; let the moisture of the vegetables reduce; at this degree, moisten them with broth : continue boiling them, then thicken them with a piece of kneaded-butter, adding to it a pinch of nutmeg ; dish them up. 856. Green-pease with butter. Put a quart of fresh green-pease into a stewpan, with a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley, a little salt, and half a glassful of water; cover them, and boil them thus on a brisk fire; thicken them, in the first place, with a little piece of kneaded-butter, then finish, them with394 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. four ounces ancl a half of good butter, divided in little bits ; add to them a pinch of sugar, and another of nutmeg; surround them with fried crusts. 857. Green-pease (au naturel) plain-boiled. Choose freshly gathered pease, which pluck; remove the largest ones, plunge them into boiling water ; add to them a bunch of parsley or mint, and a little salt; boil them on a brisk fire for twelve or fifteen minutes ; drain them immediately, when done, in a colander; dish them up, accompany them by a plate of fresh butter. — In order to get the pease of a nice green color, they must be boiled on a brisk fire; and in a red basin, or copper sugar-pan. 858. Preserved green-pease. If no fresh green-pease are at disposal , there may be procured now-a-days in every country preserved green-pease, which, if prepared well, are not without good qualities, and are very useful as a diversion. The method how to prepare these green-pease, is a very simple one: the box must be opened, then its contents turned out on a colander; now this is dipped in boiling salted water; drain the green-pease well, put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a pinch of sugar, salt and nutmeg; warm them, and thicken them either with a little white-sauce, or else simply with a piece of kneaded-butter. 859. Hop-sprigs. I will describe in one single article the different manners of pre- paring hop. In order to prepare hop ‘a la poulette’, the tender sprigs must be taken ; pluck them, slightly scrape them, wash them, boil them in aci- dulated salted water; drain them, put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, season, and let them fry for a few minutes; thicken them with a little white-sauce, finish them with a liaison, a little chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon. Hop-sprigs boiled in salted water, may also be served as salad. In order to let the hop-sprigs fry,* they must be three-parts boiled in salted water; this done, drain them, season them with salt and vinegar,VEGETABLES. — H0P-SP1TIGS, CARROTS, SORREL, SPINACH. 395 half an hour after, drain them on a cloth, flour them, put them into beaten eggs, immediately drain them, and by degrees let them drop into hot frying-fat; when they are drained, salt them, and dish them up. 860. Carrots with cream. Peel some large tender carrots, mince them in slices, or cut them up in dice ; let them blanch for two minutes in salted water ; then drain them, put them into a stewpan with some butter, add a little salt, and sugar; let them fry on a slow fire, till their moisture be reduced ; then sprinkle over a little flour, moisten them to three-fourths their height with good broth ; let the sauce boil, then remove it on a slow fire. — When the carrots are done, thicken them with a few yolks of eggs, diluted with a little cream ; add to it a pinch of nutmeg, and a piece of butter. 861. Sorrel with gravy. Remove the ribs from a little basketful of garden sorrel-leaves 5 wash them, changing the water, several times ; put them into a stewpan with a little water, let them boil till their green color is lost. Pour them on a sieve, let them drain well, and chop them; put the sorrel then into a stewpan, season it with salt and pepper, moisten it with a little gravy, boil it then quite gently for half an hour, taking care to add a little gravy from time to time ; mind, it must nevertheless remain rather consistent. 862. Spinach, with gravy, and with cream. Carefully pick a pound of fresh, and young spinach, wash it well, let it blanch in salted water, in a basin, for five or six minutes ; drain it well, refresh it, press it between the hands, in order to extract all the water; this done, chop it. Melt a little piece of butter in a stewpan ; mix into it a tablespoonful of flour, which fry for two minutes ; then add to it the spinach, and let it fry for three or four minutes, without leaving it; season it, then moisten it, either with a little gravy, or else with raw cream; fry it for a tew minutes ; finish it, introducing into it three ounces of butter.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 396 863. Spinach - custard, or cheese. When the spinach is chopped, and prepared with butter, add to it a handful of grated bread-crumb ; moisten it with a little cream, but keeping it a little consistent; boil it for a few minutes, stirring it; season it, let it cool a little ; introduce into it three whole eggs, and four yolks of eggs. Butter a ‘timbale’-mould, fill it with the preparation, which let poach in the ‘bain-marie’ for three quarters of an hour; turn it out on a dish, mask it with a little sauce. 864. Farced mad-apples. Mad-apples (aubergines) are the produce of hot climates 5 if they are indeed tender, and fresh, they are good. — Choose six small mad-apples, split them in two down their length, remove their pulp, with the aid of a spoon, leaving only a thin part; let.them drain on a sieve, then press out their moisture; spunge them lightly, let them fry with a little oil. Chop the mad-apples’pulp ; chop also two or three white onions, which let fry with oil; add to them the chopped pulp ; when these vege- tables have reduced their moisture, mix up with them two small hand- fuls of bread-crumb, in order to give the preparation some consistence; add to it some parsley chopped together with a little garlic, and a pinch of pepper ; thicken it, off the fire, with a few yolks of eggs. With this preparation, fill the halves of the mad-apples, range them on a baking- sheet, one beside the other, moisten them with oil, or butter, sprinkle over a little bread-crumb, and bake them in a slack oven. 865. Salsifies with butter. Cut the leaves and thin parts, off a score of salsify-heads; scrape them; when done, plunge them into acidulated water; then divide them in two, and let them boil in salted water, also slightly acidulated, and mixed with a pinch of flour diluted with cold water, in order to blanch the liquid. — As soon as the salsifies are done, drain them, then cut them up transversally into pieces of the length of about an inch; place these pieces in a stewpan, with a piece of butter, warm them, tossing them, season, and finish them with the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of chopped parsley.VEGETABLES. — MAD-APPLES, SALSIFIES, TOMATAS, CUCUMBERS. 397 866. Farced tomatas. Open eight or ten tomatas on the top, let the seeds come out, pressing the tomatas ; slightly salt them, and let them drain on a sieve for a quarter of an hour. Chop some pieces ot cooked beef, poultry, mutton, or pork : the§e species also may be mixed. Put into a stewpan two table- spoonfuls of chopped onion, let it fry with butter or oil, mix into it a handful of bread-crumb, and some spoonfuls jfpJ^ ot gravy, or broth, in order to obtain a stuffing of some Draw. 284. consistence 5 add to it the chopped meat, some salt, pepper, and parsley, chopped together with a little garlic; mix the preparation well, take it then off the the, and thus thicken it with a few raw yolks ot eggs, and with it, fill the tomatas; sprinkle over their top a little bread-crumb, range them side by side on a gratin-dish, moisten them with oil, let them bake in a slack oven. 867. Salsifies ‘a la poulette’. Boil the salsifies, as indicated, art. 865; then cut them up, place them in a stewpan, moisten them, just to cover, with some white- sauce ; let them simmer for a few minutes in this sauce, whereupon thicken the latter with a liaison of a few yolks of eggs ; finish the stew with a pinch of chopped parsley, a piece of butter, and last of all, the juice of a lemon. 868. Fried salsifies. Take the boiled salsifies, cut them up to equal lengths ; place them in a kitchen-basin, season, and baste them with lemon-juice or vinegar, sprinkle over them a pinch of chopped parsley; one hour after, drain, and mask them with a little frying-paste (see art. 59) ; take them up, one by one, and plunge them into hot frying-fat. As soon as the paste has taken a nice color, drain them, salt them, and dish them up. 869. Farced cucumbers. Cut off the extremities of the cucumbers, divide them into thick pieces nearly two inches long; peel them, and plunge them into boiling398 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. water; let them boil for a few minutes, remove them, refresh them, and empty them; fill them with ‘quenelle’ force-meat, mixed up with a few spoonfuls of fine-herbs. Range these pieces on the bottom of a stewpan, spread with bacon, moisten them just to cover with broth, of which the fat has not been skimmed; add to it some salt and spices, cover them with buttered paper, and braise them on a very slow fire; drain them, then trim, and dish them up. Pass the cooking-stock, through a sieve, skim off its fat, thicken it with a little sauce or kneaded-butter, finish it with the juice of a lemon, and some chopped parsley ; pour it then on the cucumbers. 870. Glazed cucumbers. Cut the cucumbers in quarters, split them in the middle, remove their seeds; peel them, let them blanch for a few minutes; then range them in a stewpan, spread with slices of raw ham ; moisten them with a little gravy, let them boil, letting the moisture reduce to glaze; then dish them up. Dilute the stock of the stewpan with a little white-wine, let it boil, thicken it with a little kneaded-butter; pass the sauce, through a sieve, over the cucumbers. — Glazed cucumbers mayx be masked with ‘bechamel’-sauce, white-sauce, brown-sauce, and even with tomata-sauce. 871. Turnips, ‘a la bourgeoise’. Peel, and cut in dice, a few large turnips; plunge them into boiling water, let them blanch for a few minutes only; drain them, put them into a stewpan with butter, salt, and a pinch of sugar; cover the stewpan, and thus boil the turnips on a moderate fire : if the turnips do not get tender, add to them from time to time a little broth; when they are nearly done, thicken them with kneaded-butter, add to them a pinch of pepper, and dish them up. 872. Large artichokes, whole or cut. In order to serve the artichokes whole and boiled, it is sufficient to shorten their leaves, to trim the bottom (see draw. 286) in removing all tough leaves; boil them, kept covered, in salted water, slightly aci-399 VEGETABLES. - TURNIPS, ARTICHOKES, CELERY. dulated, until the centre-parts, called the choke (foin), disengage them- selves ; then drain them, and remove this choke ; put them back into their liquor, then drain them, and dish them up. Boiled artichokes are served, either with butter-sauce, or else with Dutch, or vinaigrette-sauce. In order to prepare the artichokes in quarters, the leaves must be shortened, more than if they are boiled whole. Trim the bottom of the artichokes, divide each of them in four parts ; then trim them to a nice shape {see drawing 288, 289), rub them with half a lemon; half-boil them in acidulated salted water ; now drain Draw. 287.

Aitichoke-quarters may be served with brown-sauce, or with white- sauce finished with some chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon. In order to prepare artichoke-bottoms, all their leaves must be removed ; this done, trim them to a fine shape {see draw. 290, 291) ; rub them with half a lemon, range them in a stewpan, moisten them with broth, of which the fat is not skimmed; add to it the juice of two lemons, and a little white-wine; cover them with a sheet of buttered paper, boil them on a slow fire. — Artichoke-bottoms may be served with either white-or brown-sauce ; either Colbert-, or Dutch-sauce. 873. Celery-sticks with cream. Previous to boiling celery-sticks, they must be properly trimmed; this done, remove their hard stems, cut them to the length requisite’THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 400 wash them well, let them boil in plenty of water for ten minutes; then drain, refresh, and equalise them*, range them in a stewpan spread with remains of bacon ; salt them, moisten them to height, with broth from which the fat has not been skimmed, a little white-wine, or the juice of a lemon ; cover them with paper, boil them on a moderate fire; Avhen they are at the degree requisite, drain them well; trim and dish them up ; mask them with good ‘bechamel’-sauce, reduced with cream. — Celery may be served simply with a little gravy or brown-sauce. 874. Jerusalem-artichokes. Peel some Jerusalem-artichokes, trim them to a round shape; let them boil in salted water, keeping them rather firm; drain them, place them in a stewpan with butter, and thus let them fry on a slow fire ; season them; when they have well set, dish them up, and mask them with a little white- or brown-sauce. 875. Cardoons, with brown-sauce. Choose the cardoons white and tender; remove all their green stems, cut the white ones to lengths of two or three inches, wash them, plunge them into boiling salted water, acidulated with citric-acid, or white vinegar : add to them a piece of bread-crumb, in order to absorb the natural bitterness of the cardoons ; let them boil, kept covered, for twenty minutes ; then remove them with the skimmer, refresh them, wipe them well with a cloth, in order to remove the thin skin sticking to them, then range them in a stewpan spread with the remains of bacon, and moisten them to cover with light broth, of which the fat is not skimmed, add to them a little white-wine, a little acid, a teaspoonful of flour, diluted with water, a little salt, and spices. Cover them with paper, let them boil on a slow fire. At serving-time, drain the cardoons, dish them up, mask them with a little brown-sauce. — Cardoons, prepared thus, may be served also with butter-sauce, ‘bechamel’-sauce, or brown-sauce. They may be sur- rounded by crusts garnished with beef-marrow. — Cardoons may be also gratinated.401 VEGETABLES. — ENDIVE, CHESTNUTS. 876. Endive with eggs. Choose seven or eight heads of succo ry (clucoree), or endive, nicely white and fresh ; cut them up, wash them quickly, changing the water several times, plunge them into boiling salted water; boil the endive for twenty minutes, drain it on a colander, let it cool, press the water out, and chop it. Melt in a stewpan a piece of butter, add to it a tablespoonful of flour, which let fry for a few moments ; add to this the endive, stir it on the fire, until it has quite dried off; season it, gradually moisten it with good milk, but keeping it consistent; at the first bubbling up, remove it back to the side of the fire, ooil it thus for ten minutes, then put it back on the fire, let it reduce quickly, but without leaving it, and gradually introduce into it a third of a glassful of good raw cream ; as soon as it has got creamy and relishing, take it off the fire ; add to it a pinch of sugar and nutmeg, introduce into it a piece of butter, and dish it up; sunound it with halves of eggs boiled hard, placing them in an upright position : form a rosette on the centre. — Endive prepared thus may be served as an entree-garnish. 877. Roasted chestnuts. Choose the chestnuts large, split their skin on one side only ; place them m a pan with perforated bottom, let them roast at a moderate fire, and if possible on wood-charcoal; as soon as they are done to the degree requisite, wrap them up in a cloth, and thus keep them for ten or twelve minutes, then dish them up under the folds of a napkin, and serve them with blitter. 26THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 402 878. Braised lettuces. Choose the lettuces fresh, and with fine heart; remove their first leaves, wash them, changing the water several times, plunge them into boiling water, let them boil for five or six minutes; remove them with the skimmer, refresh them; extract their moisture, pressing them between the hands, fold them at the extremity, and range them, side by side, on the bottom of a stewpan spread with bacon ; season the lettuces, moisten them to height with unskimmed broth, cover them with a greased round of paper; braise them for an hour and a quarter on a slow fire, with hot ashes on the lid; when they are done, their moisture should prove reduced to glaze ; then drain them, dish them up, pour over them a little good gravy or brown-sauce. — Lettuce may be served as a garnish; it may be also farced with common force-meat, and then glazed. 879. Cauliflowers with mayonnaise. Distribute two heads of cauliflower in little flowrets; trim their stems to a point, let them boil in water, let the water be only salted when the cauliflower is nearly done; drain it, let it cool; place it in a kitchen-basin, season it with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar; then sprinkle over a pinch of parsley, and of taragon, both of which chopped ; one hour after, drain it on a sieve ; now take the flowrets up one by one, dish them up in a dome-like fashion, on a cold dish, masking each layer with a little egg-mayonnaise ; as soon as the dome is raised, mask the cauliflowers, also with a layer of mayonnaise. 880. Gratinated cauliflowers. When the cauliflowers are boiled and drained, let them cool; then divide them into flowrets, which range by layers on a gratin-disli, alter- nating these layers by a little ‘bechamel’-sauce, and sprinkling over them a little grated parmesan ; now mask them likewise with ‘bechamel -sauce, and again sprinkle over some grated parmesan; moisten them v ith butter; push them into a slack oven; let them gratinate tor twenty minutes, or else glaze them with the salamander. — Boiled cauliflowers may be served with butter-sauce, or Dutch-sauce.403 VEGETABLES. — LETTUCE, CABBAGE, CAULIFLOWER,. 881. Artichoke-bottoms, ‘a la Villeroi’. Choose some small artichoke-bottoms, cooked; if they should be large, cut them across, dip them in a ‘Villeroi’-sauce, range them, one by one, at equal distance, in an iron-plate ; let the sauce be well cooled, then roll the artichokes in grated breadcrumb; dip them in beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them again. Let them fry to a nice color, and serve them. ‘Villeroi'-sauce. The sauce, called ‘Villeroi’, is prepared with white- sauce, consistent, reduced, then thickened with raw yolks of eggs; these yolks ought to be simply brayed (broyes), and mixed with a little butter, divided into small pieces. 882. Cabbage ‘timbale’. Choose the cabbage large, either crisped, or with fine heart; remove its hard stems, disengage, one by one, all 'the tender leaves ; wash them well, let them blanch in salted water for a quarter of an hour; drain them, refresh them, spread them on a cloth. — Chop two onions, let them fry, without however allowing them to take color; add the chopped leaves of the cabbage, fry them on a slow fire, season them, take them off the fire, let them nearly cool; then mix them up with an equal quantity of sausage-meat, two handfuls of bread-crumb, a few eggs, and last ot all, with a pinch of parsley chopped. Mask the bottom and sides of a large ‘timbale’-mould, with thin slices of bacon, against which set some blanched cabbage-leaves, placed one upon the other, so as to leave no free space ; place then on the bot- tom ot the mould a layer of the force-meat previously prepared; mask this layer with cabbage-leaves ; finish filling the mould thus, layer by layer, alternating force-meat and cabbage-leaves ; cover the upper sur- lace vitli bacon, push the mould into a slack oven, and leave it therein lor an hour and a half. — Drain the fat off the mould, turn the ‘timbale’ out on a dish, remove the bacon from the top ; carefully spunge away the fat ot the dish ; pour over the cabbage a little brown-sauce. 20*THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 404 883. Minced cabbage. Cut up in quarters, one or two white cabbages; remove the hard stems; mince the tender leaves, wash them, and drain them well. — Mince an onion, which let fry with butter; when it is of a nice color, add to it the minced cabbage, pour over it a glassful of vinegar, and a little broth; season them, let them boil thus, quite gently, for three hours. Last of all, the moisture must be reduced; thicken the cabbage, then, with a piece of kneaded-butter, and add to it a pinch of powder-sugar; ten minutes after, dish it up. 884. Sour-crout. In regard to the general alimentation of the people, it is a pity that sour-crout is not more appreciated and propagated; this is the more to be regretted, as the preparation of sour-crout is a simple one, and it fur- nishes an aliment little expensive, wholesome in winter, very agreeable, as well in regard to taste, as change. — Sour-crout is prepared with cabbage-heads, common-cabbage, and colewort; but colewort is to be preferred. Remove from the cabbages the outer leaves, and the stalk; mince them line, either with the knife, or better, being more expeditions, with the aid of a cabbage-cutter, against which it is simply pressed, and rubbed off. Take one or more well cleansed half-casks, from which on one side the bottom is removed; spread on the bottom some large cabbage-leaves, over which sprinkle a layer of pulverised salt;* on this salt, range a layer of crout of the thickness of five or six inches, sprinkle] over this layer a handful of salt, then press it close together, by the aid of a pestle, in order to diminish full half the thickness of the layer ; again sprinkle over the crout a little salt, and on this place another layer of vegetable, proceeding as before. The cask being almost full, mask the minced vegetable with large whole leaves of cabbage, over which also sprinkle salt, then mask them with a * Fifty heads of cabbage will require two or three pounds of salt.405 VEGETABLES. — SOUR-CROUT, BEETROOT. wooden round, which press down with stones: this operation must be done in the cellar. As soon as the fermentation of the crout has begun; the vegetable., by this process, is covered with water it has given out; it is convenient therefore to remove this water, as it augments. After the lapse of seven or eight days, the fermentation having abated, and the liquid diminished, it is replaced by common souse, boiled and cooled. — It is well to observe, that sour-crout, while in the cask, must be kept under pressure of a weight, sufficient to make its moisture continually run out: sour-crout can be cooked and eaten, four or five weeks after being placed in the cask. Previous to boiling sour-crout, it must be well drained ; then put it into a stewpan or an earthen vessel, with a large onion, a large carrot, and a piece of streaky-bacon or raw ham; boil it for three or four hours, on a very slow fire, keeping the stewpan well closed : the sour-crout being done, all the liquid should be evaporated. Now remove the meat, as well as the onion and carrot, thicken the sour-crout with a little sauce, or a piece of kneaded-butter ; serve it, either as a garnish, or else with the bacon carved. 885. Macerated beetroots. Boil a few beetroots, peel them, mince them, range them in a jug, by layers, alternating with minced horseradish - root; add to them a few peppercorns, cover them up with vinegar. — These beetroots are employed as a garnish for cooked salads. 886. Black plums, preserved in vinegar. Choose the plums not too ripe, prick them with a fork, and range them in a jug, with cinnamon, cloves, and orange-zest; cover them up with vinegar, and let them macerate. Twenty-four hours after, pour the 's inegar into a skillet, in order to let it boil for ten minutes on a quick fire; let it cool, and again pour it over the fruit. After the lapse of twenty-four hours, repeat this operation, then let the vinegar boil with sugar (six ounces to a quart of liquid), and pour it over the fruit. When406 TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. the liquid is quite cold, cover the vessels with paper. — In the same way- are prepared, mirabels, and cherries. 887. Pickled gerkins. Take two pounds of fresh gerkins, wipe them, cut off their ex- tremities, put them into a cloth, mix up with them two handfuls of fine salt 5 shake the cloth, then hang it up in a cool place, carefully placing a vessel underneath it; twelve hours after, add two handfuls more of salt, renew this operation after the lapse of another twelve hours ; the next day, range the gerkins into jugs, cover them with good raw vinegar, mixed with half a glassful of spirits of wine, add to them spices, and taragon-leaves ; three weeks after, the gerkins are good to be eaten. 888. Portable oven. The portable oven is by far preferable to the common field-oven, the drawing of which I have given before, as with the former the heat may be regulated so, that pastry, and a great many other dishes can be baked therein. These small and inexpensive ovens are generally very useful, as their construction is simple and ingeniously contrived ; moreover, they have the advantage, that they can be easily transported, and placed in that part of the kitchen, where they will be least in the way. These ovens may be heated with either wood or coal, and both com- partments can be used for baking; but, in order to obtain a more vivid heat in the upper compartment, it is sufficient to charge the top with embers. In order to demonstrate this operation, the figure represents the oven heated below with wood, and on the top with embers. In these conditions, in the upper compartment pastry can be glazed, or different dishes gratinate. To my thinking, this oven ought to be found in every kitchen of the middle classes, it being truly indispensable, not only because of the little trouble it gives, but also by reason of the great facility it imparts407 VEGETABLES. - BLACK PLUMS, PICKLED GERKINS. to various operations. Mistresses of families, as well as cooks, are there- fore earnestly advised 4o make this acquisition ; as they ought not to Draw. 293. forget, that in a kitchen without an oven the resources of the work are beyond measure limited. The three drawings, on the following page (408), represent ‘entre- mets’-moulds ; the first (294) is a biscuit-mould, full size; the second (295) is a ‘baba’-mould, fluted; the third (296) is a full-sized ‘macedoine’- mould, which can also be employed for fruit-cheeses (pains), creams, and blanc-manger.S WE ET-E N T RE M E T S. Sweetmeats, or sweet-‘entremets’ [de douceur), either cold or warm, are indispensable at a dinner, where there are guests; that is to say, a dinner of some importance. Sweetmeats [entremets sucres) are always served either following the vegetables, if the dinner is provided with such, or Draw. 294. Draw. 295.

If in a dinner two sweetened entremets are served, it is con- venient to give one dish cold and one warm; if this be the case, it is scarcely necessary to observe, that the warm one is always served before the cold one. 889. Omelet with preserves. Break eight or ten eggs into a basin, add to them a little salt, and one tablespoonful of powder-sugar.409 SWEET-ENTREMETS. - OMELETS. Melt three ounces of butter in an omelet-pan ; mix into it the eggs, then thicken the preparation, stirring it; when the omelet has set, so that it can be disengaged, gather it on one side of the pan, then place on its centre some spoonfuls of currant-jelly or fruit-marmalade; roll the omelet up, so as entirely to enclose the preserves, and turn it out on a dish; give it a nice shape, sprinkle over tine sugar, and glaze it with the aid Draw. 297. of a carved iron made red-hot, forming thus a little ornament (see draw- ing 297). 890. Omelet ‘soufflee’, with preserves. Mix up in a kitchen-basin a quarter of a pound of flour, and three ounces of powder-sugar, dilute this with two gills and a half of milk; pass the liquid through a sieve, add to it a little zest, a grain of salt, and three ounces of butter; remove the zest; five minutes after, introduce into it, one by one, six yolks of eggs, without ceasing to work the paste; then add to it six whipped whites. Pour into a large omelet-pan, four or five tablespoonfuls of melted butter; when it is warm, pour the preparation into this pan ; two minutes after, push the pan into a slack oven, setting it on a trevet; as soon as the upper surface is set, turn the omelet over on the lid of a large stew- pan ; immediately bring it back into the pan, and again push it into the oven; five minutes after, take it out; garnish then its centre with a few spoonfuls of preserved fruit, marmalade, or jelly ; fold it up, and turn it out on a dish ; sprinkle over fine powder-sugar, and serve it immediately.410 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY- BOOK. 891. Plain omelet ‘soufflee’. Break six fresh eggs; put the yolks into a kitchen-basin, and the whites into a copper-basin. Mix up witli the yolks four tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar; work the preparation for ten minutes with a wooden spoon, in order to get it frothy. — Whip the six whites ; as soon as they are quite stiff, introduce into them four tablespoonfuls of sugar, mixed either with vanilla, lemon-zest, or orange-blossoms, crisped (pralmees) and pulverised; this mixture being operated, add the yolks of eggs. Immediately pour the preparation on a buttered long dish; then equalise it, and with the blade of a large knife cut it in two along the middle, letting the knife go down to the bottom of the dish; sprinkle the omelet over slightly with powder-sugar, push it into a slack oven, or else bake it in the field-oven : twelve or fourteen minutes will do ; when the omelet is taken out of the oven, sift over it fine sugar, and serve. — This omelet may suffice for five persons. 892. Celestine-omelet. Put into a stewpan four yolks of eggs, and one whole egg; beat, them up well with a spoon, mix into them four tablespoonfuls of flour, the same of poAvder-sugar, and three ounces of butter; dilute this pre- paration with tAvo glassfuls of milk ; pass it then, through a sieve, into a stewpan, stir it on the fire, till it be well thickened, and of a nice con- sistence ; then take it off the fire, add to it a little sugar grated on lemon, a grain of salt, tAvo spoonfuls of chopped almonds, and four tablespoonfuls of broAvn-butter. Prepare a pancake-batter (see art. 905), with four ounces of flour; with this preparation get ready six or seven pancakes, larger, and a little thinner, than they generally are prepared; spread them on a baking-sheet, garnish them transversally with a part of the Trangipane’- cream previously prepared; then fold the omelets up, so as to enclose the preparation; immediately range them on a baking-sheet, placing them one beside the other; sprinkle over them some poAvder-sugar, keep them at the entrance of the oven for ten or twelve minutes, previously to serving them.CELEST1NE-0MELET, ‘CJREPES’, EGGS ‘A LA NEIGE’. 411 893. Eggs ‘a la neige’. Break six or seven fresh eggs, putting the yolks into a kitchen- basin, ancl the whites into a copper-basin. With the yolks, half a pint of milk, six ounces of sugar, and a little zest, prepare then some good lemon-cream (see art. 899).

Household ‘crepes’. Beat four whole eggs with a little salt, and four tablespoonfuls of good olive-oil or melted butter, then with two spoonfuls of double cream. — Pass, through a sieve, into a kitchen-basin, half a pound of flour, form a hollow in its centre, and into this hollow pour the eggs; gradually introduce into them the flour, by the aid of a wooden spoon, so as to obtain a smooth paste, without giving it too much consistence; add to it two tablespoonfuls of brandy : the paste must be rather light than consistent.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 412 Melt four ounces and a half of butter, let it settle, decant it; pour a spoonful of this butter into a pancake-pan, warm it, and then pour into the pan two spoonfuls of the paste ; spread this paste over the whole breadth of the bottom of the pan; as soon as this paste takes consistence, turn the pan about itself, in order to disengage the ‘crepe’; immediately turn it over, tossing it; a minute after, slip it on to a warm small dish, and sift over it powder - sugar. Prepare thus all the other ‘crepes’, immediately placing them one upon the other, and sprinkling over each of them a little sugar : ‘crepes’ must be eaten when quite warm. 895. Chestnut-‘souffle’. Boil four dozen plucked chestnuts with a piece of vanilla and some sugar; pass them through a sieve, place the puree (ten ounces) in a kitchen-basin, add to it a little more sugar; and slightly warm it, working it with a spoon ; take it off the lire, add to it four yolks of eggs, and four ounces of butter divided in little bits. Half an hour previous to serving, introduce into this preparation five whipped whites of eggs very firm, as well as three or four tablespoon- fuls of whipped cream ; pour it into a buttered ‘souffle’-dish, which set on a baking-sheet, and push it into the oven; twenty minutes after, sprinkle over fine sugar; as soon as this is glazed, serve the ‘souffle’. 896. Sweet-spinach. Choose young tender spinach freshly gathered, boil it in salted water; drain it, press the water well out, chop it fine, let it fry with butter for a few moments ; sprinkle over a pinch of flour, gradually moisten it with raw cream ; add to it a grain of salt, powder-sugar, and a little zest; boil it for a few minutes ; thicken it, off the fire, with a few yolks of eggs, diluted with cream ; finish it, introducing into it a piece of good butter; dish it up, and surrounding it with finger-biscuits cut in a triangular shape. 897.

Roll out thin, nine ounces of puff-paste trimmings, or fine short- paste ; divide this flat into seven or eight squares. — Peel seven or eight middling-sized rennet-apples; hollow their middle with the aid of a tube, out of the column-box. Set one apple upon each of the squares of paste, butter them with the aid of the paste-brush, sprinkle over a little sugar, then fill the hollow of each of them, with some marmalade of pears, apples, plums, or apricots. Wet the edges of the paste, and with it wrap the apples up, soldering it on the top. Mask the soldering with a thin round of paste. Range the apples on a buttered baking-sheet, placing them at a little distance from one another, and thus bake them in a slack oven; ten minutes previous to taking them out of the oven, sprinkle over them fine sugar; when the^ are glazed, dish them up. 932. Apples with currants. With the aid of a column-tube, hollow the centre of six fine rennet- apples, without peeling them ; range them on a buttered gratin-dish; fill the hollow of each of these apples with well cleansed currants, previously softened in tepid water; slightly sweeten them; place a little bit of butter on each of the apples, sprinkle over a little sugar or cassonade; pour a few spoonfuls of white-wine on the dish; bake the apples in a slack oven, for twenty-five minutes ; serve them on the same dish.431 SWEET-ENTREMETS. — APPLES, &c. 933. Glazed apples. Choose some small apples of an equal size ; hollow them on their centre with the aid of a little tube out of the column-box; peel them, let them boil in acidulated, slightly sweetened water; in order to retain them quite whole, it is convenient to boil them almost without any ebullition at all, and keeping them covered. Drain them, place them in a kitchen-basin, pour over them a little syrup; let them cool; drain them, then coat them repeatedly, with the aid of a paste-brush dipped into tepid apricot-marmalade, rather consistent, so that it may stick to the apples ; decorate them then on the top with a circle of little rounds in angelica. Fill the hollow of the apples with preserved cherries, or with a little fruit-jelly : quince-, currant-, or apple-jelly; the species may also be mixed. Dish them up in a group, and decorate them with angelica-leaves. 934. Apple-mince. Pluck five or six rennet-apples, divide each of them in two, cut each of these halves into six pieces, which pieces place then in a stewpan, with six ounces of sugar, and half the zest of a lemon; moisten them to three-fourths their height with water, and the juice of some lemons; cover the stewpan, set it on the fire ; give the liquid two bubblings, then take the stewpan off the fire; when the syrup is cold, remove the zest; pour the apples and the syrup out on a deep dish, sprinkle over a pinch of currants, well washed, and serve it. 935. Apples with rice. Choose six or eight not too large Calville-apples ; cut each of them into two or four pieces; peel them, remove their cores; boil them on a very slow fire, with a little sugar, a little butter, and a little water. 'TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Blanch live or six ounces of line rice, boil it with milk, keeping it a little consistent; sweeten it only when it is done; scent it with lemon or vanilla; finish it with a little good cream, and a piece of butter; dish the rice up, surround it with the apples in syrup, pouring their syrup over them. — Pears, with rice, are prepared according to the same method. 936. Glazed apple-marmalade. Cut into quarters seven or eight apples; pluck them, place them in a stewpan with a little water, let them dissolve on a moderate lire, then pass them through a sieve. Pour the puree into a stewpan, with two thirds of its volume of fine sugar, and a little zest; put it back on the fire again, let it reduce, stirring it with a spoon, without leaving it; when it is at the degree requisite, remove the zest, pour it on a dish; smoothe it with the blade of a knife, sprinkle over fine sugar, and glaze it with the aid of an iron-skewer, made red-hot in the fire, so as to form a little rosette ; surround it with ringer-biscuits, cut in a triangular shape. 937. Fritters-sonffle. Prepare a ‘choux’-paste (see art. 1031) a little stiffer and less buttered, than is usually done; add to it a tablespoonful of lemon-sugar. — Take the paste up in equal parts with a teaspoon ; let these parts drop into warm frying-fat, keeping them as round as possible, pushing them with the finger; slightly stir the pan, fry the fritters to a nice color; when drained, sprinkle over powder-sugar, and group them in a pyramid on a folded napkin. 938. Rice-fritters. Blanch six ounces of picked rice; drain it, put it into a stewpan, moisten it largely with boiled milk; let the liquid boil, remove it to a slow fire; cover the rice, finish boiling it, keeping it consistent; when it is nearly done, sweeten it, and add to it a few spoonfuls of good raw cream, and a little zest; ten or twelve minutes after, it should be dry; take it off the fire, remove the zest, add three ounces of butter in small bits/ four raw yolks of eggs, and some spoonfuls of preserved peel,SWEET-ENTREMETS. — APPLE, PEACH, APRICOT. orange and cedrat; pour it into a kitchen-basin , let it cool. — Take the preparation up in equal parts with a spoon, roll them round on the floured table, dip them into beaten eggs, breadcrumb, and fry them; when drained, roll them in powder-sugar, and dish them up. 939. Apple-mince with bread-crusts. Cut in quarters seven or eight rennet-apples, remove their skin and core, mince the pulp ; put this then into a flat stewpan with butter; five Draw. 313. ounces of powder-sugar, a little zest; vanilla ; toss the apples on a quick Are, till the moisture is reduced : the apples must have set, but not be done too much, or to puree. On the other hand, cut off a loaf of household-bread, fifteen or sixteen crusts in the shape of long triangles, of nearly half an inch diameter ; cut five or six of them to a longer shape, and one quite round. Let these crusts take color, on both sides, in a flat stewpan with butter; when they are drained, sprinkle over sugar. Place the apples on the centre of a dish, surround them with the crusts, cut in triangular shape. On the centre form a rosette with the other crusts, placing the round one in the middle. 940. Peach, and apricot-fritters. Choose the fruit ripe, divide them each in two ; parts, remove their stones, and cut each half into two or three quarters, according to their size, peel them and range them in a kitchen-basin; sprinkle over a handful of sugar, moisten them with a little cognac.

Apple-fritters. Genuine rennet-apples are those best adapted for fritters. — Empty three or four apples with the aid of a tube out of the column-box; peel them, then cut them in thin slices transversally. Place these rings on a dish, sprinkle over a small handful of powder-sugar, moisten them with a little cognac; let them macerate for a quarter of an hour at most. Drain them, take them up, one by one, dip them into frying-paste (see art. 59), and plunge them into hot frying-fat: too many must not be fried at a time, so that the paste may remain dry. Drain the fritters, sprinkle over them fine sugar, dish them up, and serve them without delay. 942. Potato-fritters. Bake, either in the oven, or on hot ashes, a dozen large potatoes; remove their pulp, pass it quickly through a sieve; put this puree into' a stewpan, with the aid of a spoon add to it a third its volume of butter; add also eight or ten yolks of eggs, and a few spoonfuls of sugar flavored Avith vanilla or zest; Avhen the preparation is smooth, pour it on a buttered baking-sheet, and let it cool ; then distribute it in little parts, which roll on a floured slab, giving them the shape of a cork, then flat- tening them with the blade of the knife. — Divide the preparation with a round tin-cutter, dip these rounds into beaten eggs, then bread-crumb them, and let them fry; when they are drained, roll them in sugar, and dish them up. 943. Cream-fritters, with lemon. Break into a kitchen-basin four whole eggs, add to them two or three yolks of eggs, a grain of salt, and tAvo tablespoynfuls of sugar. Whip the eggs, add to them six ounces of flour; gradually dilute the paste Avith two glassfuls of milk, pass the liquid, through a sieve, into a stewpan ; add to it a piece of orange-zest, and a piece of butter.

Acacia-fritters. Gather some bunches of acacia-flowers, before the blossoms are in full blow; dip them, one by one, into some light frying-paste (see art. 59), and plunge them into hot frying-fat; when the paste has taken a nice color, drain the fritters, sprinkle over them fine powder-sugar, dish them up on a folded napkin. 945. Rice-‘eroquettes’ ‘a l’orange’. Blanch in plenty of water nearly a pound of rice, which boil in milk, keeping it rather consistent; when done, mix into it a piece of fine butter, two tablespoonfuls of orange-sugar, and eight or ten yolks of eggs. Keep the preparation a little firm, finish it by introducing six ounces o£ chopped preserved orange-peel, as well as a little whipped cream; now spread it, in layers half an inch thick, on a buttered baking- 28*THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY- BOOK. 436 sheet, cover with buttered paper; and let it cool entirely. — A few hours after, divide the preparation with a round tin-cutter, dip these rounds into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them. A few minutes previous to serving, plunge them into plenty of fat; the ‘croquettes’ being of a nice color, drain, and roll them in sugar flavored with orange, dish them in a group on a folded napkin. Send up separately a boatful of apricot- sauce (see art. 907). 946. ‘Diablotins’ with almonds. Pound four ounces and a half of almonds, dilute them with a glass- ful of cold water, pass them through a sieve; with this liquid, dilute four ounces of good rice-meal; pour the preparation into a stewpan, passing it through a sieve ; add to it a pinch of salt, a little orange-zest, an ounce of butter, and the same of sugar; stir it on the fire, until ebullition, let it reduce, without leaving off stirring, till it is firm, and of a nice consistence; take it off the fire, add to it three tablespoonfuls of kirschwasser, or cognac; pour it into a kitchen-basin, and take it up in pieces of the size of a nut, without allowing it to get cool; roll these pieces between the hands to a round shape ; this done, range them on a large dish. Warm some frying-fat, plunge half of the little balls into the liquid, in order to let them take color ; they must he of a very dark-brown shade; drain them, moisten them with a few drops of orangeflower-water; roll them in powder-sugar, dish them up on a napkin. 947. Roussettes. Put on a table six ounces of flour, form a hollow in the centre ; in this hollow, place a grain of salt, three whole eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and four tablespoonfuls of orange flower-water. Bray the eggs with the hands, introduce the flour, and form a paste of the consistence of that taken for ‘nouilles’; let it rest for ten minutes, then turn it, as is done for puff-paste, at five turns. Then roll it out, and divide it with paste-cutters, of various shape, or else cut out of its surface (with the point of a small knife) little pieces imitating fish, men, flowers, etc. NowSWEET-ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 437 plunge the cut paste into hot frying-fat, and let it fry to a nice color; when the cakes are taken out, and well drained, pour over them a few drops of orange flower-water, sprinkle over powder-sugar, and serve them. 948. ‘Nouilles’-cake, with fruits. Butter a plain border-mould, sprinkle over its sides minced raw hiouilles’; then line it entirely with fine and thin short-paste. Plunge into milk in ebullition six ounces of minced biouilles’; three or four minutes after, drain them on a sieve, put them back again into the stewpan; sweeten them, pour over them two tablespoonfuls of cream; cover them till all their moisture be absorbed ; then let them cool, intro- duce into them two whole eggs, a piece of butter, and a little grated zest. With this preparation fill the hollow of the border-mould, which push into the oven, and bake for thirty-five or forty minutes ; when it is taken out, turn it over on a dish, fill the central hollow with cut preserved fruits, on which place a group of preserved cherries. Mask the border with a little light apricot-sauce; place on the top, all round the cherries, a circle of fine greengages in compote. 949. Melting-cake, with sabayon. Let half-melt five ounces of butter; when done, pour it into a kitchen-basin, and work it well with a wooden spoon, till it is frothy; then introduce into it three yolks of eggs, one by one, and one whole egg, then five ounces of sugar, a part of which is perfumed with lemon;438 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. add the same of potato-flour, a little salt, and in the last place four whipped whites of eggs ; pour then this preparation into a flat, and buttered mould, previously glazed with potato-flour. Set this mould in a baking-sheet, bake it in a slack oven ; when it is taken out, turn it over on a dish ; pour then a 'sabayon (see art. 918) into the hollow of the cake, and serve immediately. 950. Egged crusts. Grate the crust of a few rolls, of round shape ; divide these rolls in slices of the thickness of a third of an inch ; range them, one beside the other, on a dish, moisten them with a little good raw cream, sweetened, and mixed with a few yolks of eggs. Let the crusts soak for ten or twelve minutes, moistening them with cream;- then remove them, slightly press their moisture out, and dip them into well beaten eggs, slightly sweetened; let the eggs drain, and plunge the crusts into hot frying- fat ; when they have taken a nice color, drain them, sprinkle over some sugar, dish them up, and serve them, either with some ‘sabayon’, or with some cream, or even with cherries-sauce. 951. Gratinated batter (bouillie). Dilute rive ounces of flour with a quart of tepid milk; pass the liquid, through a sieve, into a stewpan, stir it on the fire, in order to thicken it; at the first bubbling, remove it back to the side of the tire; mix into the batter two spoonfuls of sugar, a piece of zest, and a little salt; boil it thus for a quarter of an hour: it must be consistent. Pour then a quarter of this batter into another stewpan; let it reduce without leaving it, so as to give it more consistence. At this degree, take it off the fire, introduce into it three or four yolks of eggs, and let it cool. — Boil the remainder of the batter for three quarters of an hour, lightening it from time to time with a little warm milk : it must be light and free ot grains. A few minutes previous to serving it, butter a baking-sheet, and upon this spread a thin layer of the batter with eggs; bake it in a slack oven, till it has got brown, and dry; then take it out of the oven,SWEET-ENTREMETS. — RATTER, CREAM. 439 cut it and disengage it from the baking-sheet, slipping the blade of the knife underneath it.

Break into a kitchen-basin seven or eight eggs, mix up with them a few yolks, bruise them, and dilute them with a quart of milk; add to them ten ounces of powder-sugar, and a little lemon-zest; ten minutes after, pass the liquid through a sieve, pour it into the mould holding the caramel, having buttered its sides. Set the mould in a stewpan, applying it on a little trevet; pour round some hot water, so that it may reach to half the height of the mould ; let the water boil, and immediately remove the stewpan back on a very slow tire, so that the liquid preserves the same degree of heat, without boiling. Cover the stewpan, put hot ashes on its lid, and let the preparation poach for one hour at least; let the cream cool in the water ; at serving-time turn it out on a dish. 953. Orange-blossom cream. Put into a kitchen-basin four yolks of eggs, and six whole eggs; beat them up with a whisk, dilute them with a glassful and a half1 of raw cream; add to it a grain of salt, six tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, and a pinch of orange-blossoms; beat the preparation ; ten minutes after; pass it through a sieve, and pour it into a tart or pie dish (see draw. 175);THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 440 place this dish in a deep baking-sheet, with a little warm water on the bottom ; push it into a slack oven, and leave it there, till the preparation is set; then take the dish out, and serve the cream. 954. Pots of cream with lemon. Measure six little creampotf'uls of good raw milk; pour it into a kitchen-basin, introduce into it eight tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, five yolks of eggs, and three whole eggs. Bray the eggs with a whisk, mix into the preparation half the zest of a lemon, let it infuse for ten or twelve minutes ; pass the liquid then, through a. sieve, and with it, fill eight or nine cream-pots, which place in a stewpan with some warm water : it must come to half the height of the little pots. Set the stewpan on the fire, let the liquid boil, immediately taking it off the fire. Cover the stewpan, keep it at the. entrance of the oven, or else on a slow fire, with hot ashes on its lid, in order to keep the liquid at the same degree of heat, but without any ebullition. As soon as the cream has got firm, remove these little pots, wipe them, let them cool, previous to serving them. In order to prepare vanilla-cream, it is convenient to boil half of the milk, in order first of all to infuse the vanilla. — To prepare little cream-pots with coffee, the coffee must be introduced roasted in berries, proceeding as indicated for coffee-glaze. 955. Marbled, or glazed, cream. Mix up well in a kitchen-basin six or seven yolks of eggs, a table- spoonful of common flour, or of rice-rneal, and half a pound of powder- sugar ; dilute the preparation with a pint and a half of milk, pass it through a sieve, into a stewpan; stir it on the fire till it be well thickened, and ready to boil, then remove it back immediately; mix into this cream the zest of a lemon, pour it into the basin ; let it cool, stirring it from time to time; remove the zest, pour the cream on a deep dish. In order to glaze the cream, its surface must be sprinkled with pow- der-sugar ; this surface then is burnt, either with the red-hot salamander, or with an omelet-iron. — In order to marble the cream, there must beSWEET-ENTREMETS — CREAM, PINE-APPLE. 441 dropped over its surface, at little distances from one another, little drops of caramel, slightly liquored ; then with the aid of a larding-pin, spread these caramel-drops, one by one, over the surface, so as to form a marbling: nothing is more simple. — This cream may be infused, either with orange-blossoms, or with vanilla. 956. Pine-apple with rice. Pare close all the skin and pith, off half a raw pine-apple, divide it first into two pieces, then in slices not too thick ; put them into a kitchen- basin, cover them with boiling syrup, kept rather thick ; cover the basin. An hour after, pound the trimmings of pine-apple, dilute them with the Draw. 317. pine-apple’s syrup, pass it through a fine sieve, keep the puree warm. — Let blanch half a pound of rice, boil it then with milk, keeping it consistent; when it is nearly at the degree requisite, mix into it a few spoonfuls of raw cream, and a little orange-sugar; when the liquid is absorbed, take it off the fire, introduce into it three ounces of butter, divided into little bits; then dish it up, surround it with slices of pine-apple; serve the sauce separately. 957. Apple-tart. Cut in quarters eight rennet-apples, remove then’ skin and core, then divide each of the quarters in slices not too thin. — Take a pie-dish {see draw. 175) ; put on the bottom of it four cloves, or else a piece of cinnamon. Range the apples by layers alternating each of the layers with a little raw sugar {cassonnade), and pressing them close. — Raise the apples in a high dome, which also mask with some sugar. Ten minutes after, mask the rim of the dish with a little strip of fine short-TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 442 paste, then cover the apples, and the rim of the dish, with a thin flat of the same paste, which press close to the base of the dome, and to the edges of the dish, then cut it on the edge of the rim, and notch it at little distances with the aid of the point of a small knife. Moisten the paste of the dome with a little water, sprinkle over white powder-sugar. Set the dish on a small baking-sheet, bake the tart in a slack oven for fifty minutes, but covering it carefully, twelve minutes after its being put into the oven. 958. Plum-tart. Skin four or five dozen raw black plums, kept whole; stone them, and range them by layers on a tart-dish, sprinkling over each layer some raw sugar ; mask the rims of the dish with ;'a strip of fine short- paste ; cover the fruit with a flat of this same paste; channel the edges of the paste (see drawing 175) ; slightly moisten the surface of the paste, sift over fine sugar ; bake the tart in a slack oven for forty-five minutes. — These tarts may be served cold. 959. Apricot-tart. Divide, each in two parts, a score of fine apricots, not too ripe; peel them, and divide each half in two or three quarters. Crack a part of the kernels, removing the skin. — Range the apricots in a small pie- dish, by layers alternately with powdered sugar: let the fruit rise into a dome; pour at the bottom of the dish two dessertspoonfuls of water; mask the edges of the dish, with a strip of puff-paste, or fine short-paste, prepared with yolks of eggs, and a little sugar. Cover the fruit with a fiat of the same paste, fasten it round the edges, decorate the tart (see draw. 175), then moisten the paste on the top with a little white of egg, sprinkle it with line powder - sugar; bake the tart in a slack oven for forty minutes. 960. Fruit-tart. With six ounces of short-paste make a round flat, which spread on a round baking-sheet; cut the edges of this flat, moisten it all round, and on these wet parts apply a strip of puff-paste, an inch or an inch and a443 SWEET-ENTREMETS. — FRUIT-TARTS, -SAVARIN’. third wide (see draw. 232); solder this strip well, and egg it on the top; prick the surface of the flat of short-paste, in order to prevent its swelling when it bakes.

Let the tart cool, previous to garnishing it with fruit. Such tarts may be garnished with a macedoine of spring-fruit cooked as for compote, dished up taste fully, and at the last moment masked with a thick, and perfumed syrup. — These tarts may also simply be garnished with peaches, apricots, cherries, or green gages. 961. ‘Savarins’, with punch and fruits. Pass through a sieve into a kitchen-basin, ten ounces of flour. Dilute half an ounce of good beer-yeast with half a glassful of warm Draw. 318. milk; with this liquid, and a the fourth part of the flour, prepare a light dough in this same basin, let it rise in the hot-closet, then work it with the hand, and introduce into it, one by one, four whole eggs, at the same time gradually introducing the remainder of the flour; add to it three ounces of butter, three ounces of sugar, then four or flve whole eggs, but by degrees only, and without ceasing vigorously to work the paste, in order to give it a proper stiffness; in the last place, mix up with it a pinch of lemon-zest, then two or three spoonfuls of raw cream. Cover the basin, let the paste rise, in the temperature of the kitchen; when it is light, take it with the hand, in little parts only, and with it fill a score of buttered dariole-moulds : filling them but to three quarters. Let the paste rise again, till it comes up to the height of the moulds.444 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK Lake the cakes then in a hot oven for twenty-five minutes ; when they are taken out, turn them over, then dip them into a warm punch- syrup; let them drain well, then cut their top, and dish them up; moisten them again with some punch-syrup, and serve them. 962. Tart with preserves. Take a pound of puff-paste, with butter, at six turns ; roll it out, giving it a long shape of the thickness of a good third of an inch ; let the paste rest for ten minutes, then cut out of its thickness a strip, one inch wide, and twenty-five inches long. Gather then the trimmings of the paste, divide them in two parts, roll them out, and thus shape two round flats, one of which is a little thicker than the other; spread the thicker flat on a round baking-sheet, moisten its edges, and mask its centre with a layer of consistent apricot-marmalade. Fold the second flat in four, chisel it through and through, with the blade of a small knife, so as to form any fanciful design; then spread this flat all over the marmalade, in order exactly to cover up the first flat. Press the flat on, allround, moisten it, cut it on the edges, and apply the strip of puff-paste on the wet part, soldering both the extre- mities. Egg this strip, and push the tart into a slack oven ; four or five minutes previous to taking it out of the oven, sprinkle over fine sugar, let it glaze to a nice color, let it cool, and serve it. 963. Hot-baba. Pass, through a sieve, into a kitchen-basin, a pound and three ounces of fine, well-dried flour. With a quarter of this flour, half an ounce of yeast, and a glassful of warm milk, prepare some light dough; let it rise in the hot-closet. Gather the remainder of the flour into the basin, form a hollow in its centre, add to it a grain of salt, two spoonfuls of raw cream, two spoonfuls of sugar, four whole eggs, and six ounces of good butter; introduce the flour into the liquid, working the paste with the hands; when it is smooth, add to it four whole eggs more, introducing one after the other, and always working the paste vigorously ; when the eggs areSWEET-ENTREMETS. — BABA, JELLY. 445 absorbed, add four ounces and a half of butter, divided in little bits. Five minutes after, mix the dough into the paste, which work for live or six minutes more; then add to it a handful of Smyrna-raisins, an equal quantity of currants, and nearly the same of preserved peel cut up. Butter a cylinder-mould Take the paste up in small portions with the hands, and with it, three-quarters till the mould ; let the paste rise, in the temperature of the kitchen, for an hour: it ought then to come up to the height of the rim. Bake the cake in'a slack oven, when it is taken out, turn it over on a dish, mask it Avith orange-cream or apricot- sauce, or else with chocolate-sauce. — With this quantity of pre- paration two cakes can be made. — The ‘baba’ may be less light than the ‘savarin’. 964. Calf’s-foot-jelly, with rum. Singe and bone two calf’s-feet, put them into a stewpan with cold water, let the liquid boil, for six minutes ; then drain the feet, and refresh them; moisten them again with water, and a glassful of wine ; add a tablespoonful of sugar ; when the liquid boil, remove the stewpan back to the side of the tire, and very gently boil the feet, until they be tender ; then pass the liquid, Draw. 310. through a sieve, into a kitchen - basin; carefully skim off its fat, first with a spoon, then with an unsized paper, in order to remove all the fat. Try a small part of the gelatinous liquid on ice in order to judge of its consistence, then take three quarters of a jelly-mould-ful of this liquid, and pour it into a stewpan ; add to it six ounces of sugar in pieces, the juice of a lemon, and a little cold water. When the sugar has dissolved, and the preparation cooled, mix up with it two whipped whites of eggs, lightened with a little cold water;THE HOUSEHOLD COOKED Y- HOOK. 44(3 clarify it, and filter it (see draw. 59); when it is nearly cold, add to it some spoonfuls of good rum, pour it into a jelly-mould set solidly in a basin, and surrounded with pounded ice (see draw. 319) ; cover the mould with a vessel filled with ice, keep it thus until the jelly has got firm. — At serving-time, dip the mould quickly into warm water, wipe it, and turn the jelly out on a very cold dish. — If desirous of obtaining a good, and delicate jelly, it must not be made too stiff, and glutinous, and must be left to settle in a china- or crystal vessel, wherein it is to be served. 965. Jelly with kirsch-wasser. Prepare three gills of very clear sweetened jelly (see art. 964); pour it into a vessel, let its heat evaporate, stirring it with a silver-spoon, add to it half a glassful of good kirsch-wasser, pour it into a jelly-mould, which place in a basin, surround it with pounded ice, and let the prepara- tion set for full an hour. At serving-time, dip the mould in warm water, wipe it, and turn the jelly over on a cold dish. 966. Jelly, with violets. Clarify an ounce and a half of fine gelatine, with half a glassful of wafer, little sugar, some lemon-juice, and a pinch of sugar (see art. 964). Clarify twelve ounces of sugar with one white of egg, a pint of water, and half the juice of a lemon. — When the syrup is filtered, put it into a sugar-pan, lot it warm well; take it then off the fire, and plunge into the liquid a handful of very fresh violets, gathered recently, but especially well picked, that is, free of stems; cover the stewpan, ten minutes after, pass the infusion through a fine sieve, mix it up with the clarified gelatine; then add to the preparation a few tablespoonfuls of good cognac or kirsch; pour it into a mould, let it set on ice (see draw. 319). At serving-time, dip the mould into warm water, and turn the jelly out on a cold dish. By the same proceeding may be prepared jellies with orange- blossoms, roses, lilacs, and jessamine. The quantity of flowers requisite is in the inverse ratio to the strength of their perfume: the more penetrating447 SWEET-ENTREMETS. — JELLIES. their perfume is, the fewer are required. — If the flowers prove too little perfumed, their qualities may be supplied by adding to the preparation a few drops of extract distilled from these flowers. 967. Peacli-tartlets with rice. Line a dozen tartlet-moulds with fine short-paste; fill the hollow of the tartlets with a layer of rice with cream, perfumed, and thus bake them in the oven ; when they are taken out, finish filling them with the same rice, finished with cream ; then set on the top of each of them half a peach cooked for compote ; immediately coat them with their own syrup reduced, and set on each of them half a peach-kernel. Dish the tartlets up on a napkin. 968. Raspberry-jelly. Prepare a gelatinous composition with fifteen ‘gelatine’- leaves, proceeding, as said, art. 964. Bray a few handfuls of very fresh raspberries, ripe to the degree requisite ; add to them a small handful of powder-sugar, pour them on a sieve in order to extract their juice; add to this juice that of an orange, filter it through (see art. 73); when it is limpid, mix it up with the gelatinous preparation, being clear, cold, and liquid; pour then this preparation into a crystal vessel, let it set on ice, for one hour at least, then serve it. — This method of serving jellies may be less attractive, than the preceding ones, but it gives better results ; as good jelly must not be so much limed, as to become too gelatinous. 969. Whipped jelly, with fruits. Place in a kitchen-basin a large ‘salpicon’ of preserved fruit: pine- apple, greengages, apricots ; add to it some preserved cherries whole; moisten the fruits with a little kirsch. Prepare about a quart of jelly (see art. 964) limed a third less than is generally done; when it is strained, pour it into a little copper-basin; then set the vessel on ice, gently stir the liquid with a whip ; add to it Draw. 320.448 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. the juice ot two or three lemons: the preparation must not be too frothy; as soon as it begins to thicken, take it off the ice, mix up with it the ‘salpicon’ of preserved fruit. Pour the jelly into a cylinder-mould, set in a kitchen-basin, and surrounded with ice. One hour after, turn the jelly out, and serve it. 970. Cocoa-cream jelly. Clarify three ounces of ‘gelatine’ (see art. 964), with three quarters of a jelly-mould-ful of water, half a pound of sugar, two whole eggs, and the juice of a lemon ; when it is filtered, and cooled, mix into it half a glassful of cocoa-cream-liqueur, pour it into a mould placed in a basin, and surrounded with pounded ice (see draw. 319); an hour after, dip the mould quickly into warm water, turn the jelly over on a warm dish, and serve it up. — Proceeding according to the same method, jellies may be prepared with any fine liqueurs : Bordeaux-anisette, cream of moka, cream of vanilla, etc. 971. Orange-jelly. Place twenty leaves of tine ‘gelatine’ in a stewpan with cold water, in order to soften them; then drain this water off. Fill the jelly-mould, which is to be employed, with tepid water; pour this water on the ‘gelatine’, let it dissolve on a slow fire, stirring it with a spoon ; add to it half a pound of sugar, immediately take it off the fire, let it nearly cool. Very slightly whip two whites of eggs, add to them the juice of three lemons, dilute them with the dissolved ‘gelatine’; whip the preparation on the fire, get it frothy, warming it; at the first sign of ebullition, mix into it the juice of one lemon more, and remove it back to the side of the fire, with hot ashes on the lid of the stewpan, in order to keep the liquid very warm, without yet allowing it to boil; when it is clear, take it up with a very clean spoon, pour it into a bag, in order to filter it until it flows quite clear. Press out the juice of six oranges, mix into this juice a few blades of zest, filter it through (see art. 73); then mix it up with the preparation limed, but cold and liquid. — Place the jelly-mould in a kitchen-basin,449 SWEET-ENTREMETS. — JELLIES. &c. surround it with the pounded ice, up to the height of the rim; put also some ice into the cylinder of the mould, then fill the hollow of the mould with the jelly-preparation, in order to let it set: it requires an hour at least, and in summer-time perhaps more. — At serving-time, plunge the Draw. 321. mould into tepid water, wipe it quickly, and turn the jelly out on a very cold dish ; surround its base with some small round cakes. 972. Jelly with cresses. Clarify sixteen or eighteen leaves of ‘gelatine’ with twelve ounces of sugar, the requisite water, two whites of eggs, and the juice of two lemons ; pass it through a filtering bag (see draw. 59). Pound, in a very clean mortar, two or three handfuls of fresh, well washed water-cresses ; mix into them half a glassful of cold water, and press them out in a cloth, gathering their liquid; which then filter on a small sieve, the bottom of which is masked with a layer of torn, softened, and chopped paper. When the juice has passed, mix it into the cold jelly, which pour into a jelly-mould placed in a basin, and surrounded with pounded ice (see draw. 319). An hour after, the jelly must have set; turn it out on a cold dish, and serve it. 973. Cold chestnut-pudding, with fruits. Pack up, with salted ice, a cheese-mould, which then keep covered. Let six leaves of gelatine dissolve with a glassful of water, and half a pound of sugar ; with this liquid, dilute a pound of chestnut-puree 29THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 450 (see art. 980); thicken then this preparation, stirring it on ice; add to it a fine ‘salpicon of preserved fruit, mixed up with some small raisins, and a few spoonfuls of maraschino ; pour the preparation into the mould, which shut up; lute the junctures with common paste, and cover the mould with ice; let it pack thus for three quarters of an hour; then dip it into tepid Avater, and turn the pudding out on a cold dish. f .. 974.

Mask the decoration with a layer of cut finger-biscuits ; upon these biscuits, range some preserved fruits; then pour a little cream into the mould, just sufficient to cover biscuit and fruit. Let this cream set, then begin the operation again, until the mould be full. Half an hour after, dip the mould in warm water, and turn the pudding out on a cold dish ; mask it with the remainder of the liquid cream. 977. Glazed ‘souffle’, with vanilla. Set a ‘souffle’-dish in around stewpan, or any other vessel with cover shutting close on the outside. Set the vessel in a bucket, letting it rest on a thick layer of ice, pounded and strongly salted; surround it likewise with the same ice. 29*452 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Put six yolks of eggs into a sugar-pan, bray them, and dilute them with a gill and a half of boiling vanilla-syrup, not too still (25 degrees). Whip the preparation vigorously, on the fire, for two minutes, withdraw it, without ceasing to whip it, until it become quite cool again; whip it then on ice for seven or eight minutes longer; then incorporate, by the aid of a spoon, the value of two gills of whipped cream. With this preparation fill the ‘souffle’-dish {see draw. 302); shut 'the vessel down close, and cover it with a thick layer of salted ice; an hour after, renew the ice, cover it, and keep the‘souffle’thus, another hour. At serving-time, take out the ‘souffle’, sprinkle it all over with a pinch of biscuit-powder, mixed with some fine vanilla-flavored sugar. 978. Cream, with rum. Dissolve, with a glass of water, twelve or fourteen ‘gelatine’-leaves. Put eight yolks of eggs into a stewpan, with a spoonful of fecula, and four spoonfuls of powder-sugar ; work the preparation with a spoon, dilute it with a glassful of water, stir it on a slow fire until it be thickened; take it off the lire, the moment it begins starting to ebullition, pour it into a kitchen-basin, and let it cool. — Dilute four tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade with a glassful of good rum, then with the cream; pass the preparation through a sieve, mix up with it the ‘gelatine’, stir it for a few minutes on the ice, in order to thicken it; pour it into a cylinder-mould, surrounded with ice. When the cream has set, dip the mould into warm water, wipe it, and turn the cream out on a dish. 979. Apple-cream, with orange. Prepare a marmalade of rennet-apples with orange-zest, little sweetened, and reduced without excess; when it has nearly cooled, dilute it with the juice of three or four oranges, and then with eight leaves of ‘gelatine’ dissolved with a little water, the juice of a lemon, and a little sugar. Pass the preparation through a sieve, into a sugar-pan; which set on ice, and stir the preparation till it begins to thicken. Pom it then into a mould, previously surrounded with ice.

Chestnut-puree, with cream. Remove the shell and skin from fifty chestnuts, parboiling them; boil them (short of moisture, and keeping the stewpan shut) with a little water or milk, a handful of sugar, and half a stick of vanilla ; when the chestnuts are done, they must be dry; then pass them through a sieve; place the puree in a stewpan, add to it half its weight of sugar; stir it on a slow fire, till it has dried, and become firm ; then remove it back, Draw. 324. and pass it through a large sieve or colander, taking a small quantity at a time, so as to get a kind of vermicelli; this done, take the vermicelli up with a spoon, and dish them up in a circle. Now, introduce a part of the chestnut-puree into a bag with funnel, or a paper-cornet, and with it, squeeze some strings through on to the circle, so as to complete the border represented by the drawing ; into the centre of this border, place then some whipped cream, sweetened, and perfumed with vanilla. 981. Maraschino-chariot. Choose a ‘chariot’-mould, mask the bottom with a round of paper, then with finger-biscuits, cut in a triangular shape, so as to form a rosette. Range in an upright position, against the sides of the mould, some finger-biscuits, cut straight on the ends, and sides, thus forming a biscuit-case.454 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Put into a sugar-pan three quarters of a glassful of syrup perfumed with orange, the same of good maraschino, and eight leaves of ‘gelatine dissolved with a little water. Set the pan on the ice, stir the preparation till it he well thickened ; then introduce into it a glassful of whipped cream, mixed with a little perfumed sugar. Stir the preparation for two minutes more, and pour it into the chariot-mould : after the lapse of an hour the preparation must have got firm ; wipe the mould, and turn the chariot out on a dish. 982. Glazed chariot. Mask the bottom of a chariot-mould with finger - biscuit cut to a point, and ranged in a rosette; then cut across the centre with a paste- cutter ; range the biscuit cut straight to the sides of the mould, which keep on ice. — Put into a basin some preserved fruits, which are washed, and cut in dice or quarters, such as: greengages, cher- ries, green almonds, apricots, quinces; let them macerate in kirsch for an hour. At serving-time, spread on the bottom of the mould a layer of ice- ‘plombicre’ with cream or fruits ; upon this layer, range the preserved fruits, and upon them, another layer of ice. When the mould is full, turn the chariot out on a dish, and surround it with a circle of nice ‘reine-claudes’. 983. Fruit-chariot. Spread a chariot-mould with sweetened short-paste (.see art. 91—); interiorly mask the paste with paper, then fill the hollow with common flour, in order to bake it thus ; when it is taken out of the oven, empty it, mask it interiorly with a layer of apricot - marmalade; put it back itito the well-wiped mould. — Prepare a coarse ‘salpicon of washed pre- served fruits, such as apricots, pears, plums, cherries, and pine-apple; let them macerate in maraschino for two hours.

Peel two good apples, empty them in their centre, with the aid of a column-tube ; cut them transversally, in thin slices forming rings.464 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Choose three sweet and juicy oranges; peel them to the quick, then cut them to transversally in slices. Range the slices of apple and orange, in a circle, on a dish, alternating them; sprinkle over powder-sugar, moisten them with a little good kirsch or with rum. 1003. Biscuit, with brown-bread. Work up together, in a kitchen-basin, half a pound of powder-sugar with ten or twelve yolks of eggs ; when the preparation is become quite frothy, add four ounces of black-bread crumb, grated, dried, and then pounded ; add likewise four ounces of dried ana ground almonds, a pinch of powder-cinnamon, and cloves in powder, a little scraped choco- late, and lastly, eight or nine whipped whites of eggs. Spread out, on a baking-sheet, a flat of sweetened short-paste, of square form ; on this paste, spread out the biscuit-preparation, giving it about the thickness of an inch ; sprinkle it with a little sugar, bake it in a slack oven ; when it is cool again, mask it on the top with chocolate- icing-sugar; immediately cut up the flat into cakes having the form of a long square. 1004. ‘Porte-manteaux’. Make a flat of thin puff-paste of a long shape, and two or three inches wide; mask it with some marmalade, leaving a little space free on the sides ; moisten this space, then fold the paste over the marmalade, so as to wrap it up well; solder it on the extremities, pressing it on. Range these cakes at a little distance from one another on a baking- sheet, egg them, bake them in a hot oven; a few minutes previous to taking them out, sprinkle over sugar, in order to glaze them to a nice color ; serve them cold. 1005. Small orange-baskets. Choose the small oranges of an equal size; cut them in a perpendi- cular direction, from the top of each side of the stem, to three quarters height, leaving between the two cuts a breadth of a fifth of an inch;465 SWEET-ENTREMETS. - GLAZED ORANGES. then cut the oranges transver sally, on both sides, so as to disengage both the parts:.the orange then imitates a little basket with a handle to it. Carefully remove the pulp of the oranges, which then plunge into cold water; spunge them well, and keep them on the ice. — On the other hand, prepare some orange-jelly not much limed (see art. 971); when it is cold, stir it on the ice, and immediately, when it begins to thicken, mix it up with a ‘salpicon’ of various Dl'aw-329- fruits, raw and cooked. Take the jelly up then with a spoon; and with it till the little baskets; which dish up on a folded napkin. 1006. Glazed oranges. Choose three or four large oranges, very line and ripe; remove their peel, without damaging the pulp, remove likewise their white skin or pith ; disengage the quarters, without cutting them , prick each of them with a small pointed skewer, range them on a grate, or on a sieve, let them dry in the tepid hot-closet for one hour or two. Put into a sugar-pan (draw. 330) a pound of sugar, in pieces, moisten it with a glassful of water, boil it till brittle (au. casse), skimming it; take it then off the lire, and two minutes after dip into fbe liquid the quarters of orange, one by one, so as to coat them entii ely . this operation must be executed quickly. Let the sugar drain, then stick in the skewers at the opposite end, on a grate of iron-wire, in an inclined direction: in order to have the operation quickly executed, there must be two persons. When the sugar is dry, disengage the quarters of orange.* In older to ascertain this degree of the sugar, dip the finger in cold water; when taken out, dip it into the sugar, and then back again into the cold water ; a few moments after, the sugar ought to loosen from the finger, and break off short, on trying to bend it.

Five ounces of sugar, five ounces of butter, eleven ounces of flour, two eggs, a gill and a half of milk, an ounce and a half of carbonate, a pinch of nutmeg-blossoms, preserved cedrat. Let the butter get tepid, pour it into a kitchen-basin, and work it ' with a spoon, so as to thicken it to cream; then introduce into it the eggs one by one, then the carbonate, sugar, flour, and milk, by degrees, and working the preparation with the spoon: the paste must be just of consistence to maintain itself without spreading when raised up ; take it up then with a tablespoon in equal pieces of the size of a nut; range these pieces, at a little distance from one another, on a baking-sheet, and place on each of them a little pinch of preserved cedrat, cut in small dice. Bake the buns in a slack oven, serve them cold. 1008. Portuguese-cakes. Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of sugar and six yolks of eggs ; work the preparation with a spoon, till it be frothy ; pound foui ounces of almonds with one white of egg, pass them through a sieve, place them in a kitchen-basin, mix into them a pinch of orange-sugar, and dilute them with 4ie juice of four oranges. When the biscuit-preparation is frothy, carefully mix into it four ounces of potato-flour; and then the six whipped whites of eggs. Pour the preparation on a baking-sheet, previously buttered and covered with paper, spreading it in a layer of the thickness of an inch; bake it in a slack oven. When the biscuit has cooled, trim its upper surface, mask this side in the first place with a thin layer of apricot-marmalade, then with a layer of orange icing-sugar. Orange icing-sugar is prepared with sugar passed through a silken sieve, mixed with sugar rubbed against the peel of an orange, and then grated; this sugar is diluted, to the consistence required, with orange- juice : the preparation is of the utmost simplicity.467 PASTRY. — CAKES. CANNELONS, RHEIMS-RISCUITS. 1009. ‘Cannelons’ with preserves. The method how to prepare ‘cannelons’ has been given above (see art. 347) ; but when they are meant to be served as a sweetmeat, there must be sprinkled over them some powder-sugar, a few minutes previous to taking them out of the oven, in order to glaze them ; when they have cooled, empty them, and fill them either with apple-, currant-, or quince-, Draw. 331. jelly, or with any fruit-marmalade, or even with any sort of cream, warm or cold ; dish them up in a pyramid. f 1010.

Butter some Rheims- biscuit -moulds (see draw. 332) with melted Aeal-suet; let the moulds drain, and glaze them with fecula; then fill them to three quarters only, and bake them in a brisk oven. The 30 * %■THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 468 draw. 333 represents the baked cake. — On taking them out of the oven, set them in the hot-closet, and keep them thus for two or three hours ; then turn the biscuits out. — Rheims-biscuits are served with the dessert, they are commonly eaten by dipping them into champagne ; yet a receipt will be now given, how to serve them also as an entremets. 1011. Rlieims-biscuits, with cream and kirsch. This sweetmeat, although simple, yet is very estimable. — Place a dozen Rheims-biscuits in a deep dish, pour over them some good kirsch, in order to soak them thoroughly, then mask them with cold vanilla, or lemon-cream prepared in the conditions prescribed, art. 889, and serve them immediately. 1012. Conde-cakes. Mix up in a kitchen-basin four spoonfuls of chopped almonds with an equal quantity of powder-sugar; dilute them gradually with whites of eggs, so as to obtain a liquid batter. Form a strip of trimmings of puff-paste, keep it of a long shape, giving it two or three inches of width; mask the surface of this strip, with the almond-preparation, then cut it straight on the sides, and cut the cakes transversally to the thickness of an inch ; remove these pieces, when cut, with the aid of the blade of a knife, and range them, at a little distance from one another, on a baking-sheet; sprinkle over fine sugar, bake them in a slack oven; when they are cold, dish them up. 1013. Apple-tartlets. Line the tartlet-moulds with sweetened paste prepared as said for pear-timbale (see art. 912). Cut some apples up in quarters, peel them, and mince them trans- versally, so that the slices be not too broad; put them into a kitchen- basin, sprinkle over lemon-sugar, and a handful ot currants ; let them macerate for an hour ; then fill up the moulds, letting the apples bulk out; cover the apples with a round of the same paste, solder it to the edges of the flat; bake the tartlets in a slack oven for forty minutes; when they are taken out of the oven, sprinkle over them powder-sugai.469 PASTRY. — CAKES. TARTLETS, BRIOCHES. 1014. Small brioches. The paste for small brioches is the same as the one employed for large brioches or rings. In order to prepare these brioches, the paste must be taken when it is broken and well cooled (see art. 1037) ; divide it, roll it out in strings of the thickness of at least an inch ; then transversally divide these strings in such a manner as to obtain these portions all of an equal size; mould these portions, that is fold the paste up with the lingers rounding it. This done, place each portion in a buttered brioche- mould, observing that the folded part of the brioche is placed below. Form a hollow in the centre of the paste, introduce into it another little piece of paste, moulded in a long shape, and pointed at one end: this is the thing called the head of the brioche. Egg the upper surface of the brioches, bake them in a hot oven for twenty minutes. 1015. Apricot-tartlets, with cream. Line a dozen tartlet-moulds with sweetened short-paste, such as described, ail. 912; till the hollow of the mould with a preparation of pastry- cream, bake them in a slack oven for twenty-five minutes; when they have half-cooled, mask the surface of the cream with a layer of apricot-marmalade, kept rather consistent. Place on each of these tartlets half an apricot of-a nice color, peeled, very slightly cooked in compote, and cold; surround the fruit with two rows of little beads in ‘meringue’, push the tartlets again into a slack oven, in order to dry the ‘meringue’; when they are taken out, serve them. 1016. ‘Nouilles’-cakes, with sabayon. Chisel a pound or a pound and a quarter of ‘nouille’-paste, plunge it into three glassfuls of milk in ebullition; .add to it a handful of powder-sugar, and five or six ounces of butter; three minutes after,470 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-LOOK. remove the nouilles back to the side of the tire, let them simmer for ten minutes, then take them off the fire; add to them seven or eight yolks of eggs. Pour the preparation then on a buttered baking-sheet, giving it the thickness of a third of an inch ; smoothe it with the blade of a knife, push it into a slack oven. When it has taken consistence, turn it out on another baking-sheet, and bake it for ten minutes more; take it off the fire, sprinkle over powder-sugar, divide it in rounds, or else in long squares. Dish the cakes up in a circle, serve them with some wine-sabayon, {see art. 918). — These cakes may be meringued. 1017. Cherry-tartlets. With some sweetened short-paste {see art. 912) line a dozen tartlet- moulds ; prick the paste, mask the bottom and sides, with a layer of apricot-marmalade, or else mask it with paper, and fill the hollow with Hour; bake the tartlets in a slack oven ; when they are taken out of the oven, empty them, mask their interior with a little marmalade; then garnish them with raw cherries, moisten them with cold and very thick syrup. 1018. Apple and cream-tartlets. Butter, and line with short-paste, a dozen tartlet-moulds; till them with good apple-marmalade ; bake them in a slack oven ; let them cool, then mask them on the top with a layer of apricot-marmalade, which again mask with whipped vanilla-cream. Smoothe this cream, and pile it in a dome-like shape. 1019. Cheese-tartlets. v Wrap up in a fine linen cloth, four or five ounces of white curd cheese, tie it with a thread, keep it under press for several hours; afterwards pound it, mik with it a piece of butter, three or four yolks of eggs, two spoonfuls of sugar; pass it through the sieve ; put it into a kitchen-basin, mix with it the zest of a lemon grated on sugar, add two dessertspoonfuls of cognac, or of rum.471 PASTRY. - CREAM-, CHEESE-. ALMOND-TARTLETS. With some fine short -paste, or some trimmings of puff-paste, line fifteen tartlet-moulds; till them with the preparation, place upon this a thin slice of preserved cedrat. Bake the tartlets in a slack oven; on taking them out, sprinkle them with sugar, and serve them. 1020. Almond-cake. Pound a quarter of a pound of blanched almonds, the same of sugar, a bit of zest, gradually adding to it one white of egg ; when the pre- paration is converted into paste, mix up with it two tablespoonfuls of rum, and pass it through a sieve. Draw. 337. Take three quarters of a pound of puff-paste at eight turns; divide it in two ; roll these two pieces out in a flat of round shape. Spread one of these flats on a round baking-sheet; on this flat spread the almond- preparation : it must come up to half an inch of the edges of the paste; moisten the space left free. Cover the preparation, as well as the paste, with the second flat; press it on all round, then cut it regularly ; egg the surface, then trace lines on it with the point of a knife (see draw. 337). Bake the cake in a slack oven for forty minutes; five minutes previous to taking it out of the oven, sprinkle over fine sugar : it must be served cold. 1021. Almond-tartlets. Line a dozen tartlet-moulds with some sweetened paste, prepared according to the method prescribed, art. 912 ; cut the paste on the rims of the mould, then mask the bottom with a thin layer of marmalade. Pound six ounces of blanched almonds, dried in the hot-closet, mixing up with them, by degrees, the same of fine sugar, a little zest,THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 472 and six yolks of eggs ; remove the preparation out of the mortar, pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, introduce into it eight whipped whites of eggs. Immediately fill the tartlets, sprinkle over fine sugar, bake them in a slack oven for twenty-five to thirty minutes. 1022. Apricot-flawn. Butter a plain or channeled dawn-circle, which place either on a baking-sheet, or on a tart-dish; line it with trimmings of puff-paste, or with thin short-paste ; cut the paste at a level with the rim ; mask the bottom with a thin layer of powder-sugar. Upon this sugar, range halves of peeled raw apricots, so as to pretty well dll up the hollow; sprinkle over sugar. Bake the dawn in a slack oven for thirty-five minutes, and serve it cold. 1023. Cream-flawn, ‘a la menagere’. Put into a kitchen-basin three ounces and a half of sugar, a dessertspoonful of dour ; add, one after the other, four or five whole eggs. Dilute the preparation with four gills of raw milk ; pass it through a sieve, add a morsel of zest, stir it over the fire, for two minutes only. Butter a dawn-mould, line it with trimmings of puff-paste, it should be thin. Pour the preparation into the dawn, after having removed the zest; bake it in a very slack oven for forty-five minutes. As soon as the preparation begins to set, cover it with paper ; on taking it out, sprinkle it with sugar. Withdraw the mould, and serve the dawn. 1024. Cherry-flawn. Remove the stems and stones from some sour cherries, not too ripe. — Line a dawn - circle with thin short-paste; cut the paste at the level with the rim. Mask the bottom with a slight layer of powder-sugar, then range the cherries on the sugar, pressing them close together, and sprinkle them also with sugar. Bake the dawn in a slack oven, for thirty-five minutes ; serve it cold. According to this method may also be prepared clierry-tartlets.PASTRY. — APRICOT-, CREAM-, CHERRY-, APPLE-FLAW]^ 473 1025. Cream-flawn, with ‘frangipane’. Break into a kitchen-basin four whole eggs; add to them four table- spoonfuls of flour, and the same of sugar ; dilute the preparation with two glassfuls of milk, pass it through a sieve, into a stewpan ; add to it a piece of butter, a grain of salt, and two spoonfuls of chopped almonds. Stir the preparation on the fire, in order to thicken it; let it boil for a few minutes, take it off the fire, add to it three ounces of butter and a spoonful of lemon-sugar. Butter a flawn-circle (see draw. 338), line it with thin short-paste, and pour into the hollow the cooled cream- preparation. Bake the flawn in a slack oven for thirty-five minutes ; when it is turned out of the mould, and has cooled, mask it Draw. 338. with a layer of marmalade, which then mask with some icing-sugar, or else with a layer of ‘meringue’ (see art. 1029); in the latter case, the sur- face must be decorated with the cornet, and the ‘meringue’ is sprinkled with fine sugar, and slightly colored in a very slack oven. 1026. Apple-flawn, with open-work. Prepare a short-paste with three quarters of butter to each pound ot flour, three yolks of eggs, four tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, a grain of salt, and a little water. Let the paste rest. With this paste, line a flawn-circle ; cut it at the level of the rim of the mould, mask the bottom of the flawn with a layer of mar- malade ; then fill the hollow with good apple-marmalade, perfumed, sweetened, and reduced to the degree requisite. With strings of the same paste, rolled on the floured slab, form some open-work (trellice-work), soldering these strings with the paste of the rim ; pinch the paste on the top all round, egg it, push it into a slack oven, bake it for thirty-five minutes ; sprinkle over sugar, a few minutes before taking it out of the oven : let it cool previous to removing the mould.474 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 1027. Pear-flawn, with cream. Prepare a cream with four ounces of Hour, five ounces of sugar, one whole egg, three yolks of eggs, a grain of salt, a piece of zest, and three ounces of butter: it must not be too thick ; keep it at the side of the Hre. Line a flawn-circle with short-paste, or trimmings of puff-paste; mask the paste with buttered paper; fill the hollow with common flour, and thus bake the Hawn. When it is taken out of the oven, empty it, fill it nearly to height with the cream previously prepared ; upon this cream, range then, one beside the other, and in an upright position, whole small pears, cooked in compote, but reddened ; moisten them with a little of their own syrup, and thus serve the Hawn up. In order to get the pears red, they must be blanched in water for a few minutes, then place them in a sugar-pan, with a little syrup, and a few drops of liquid vegetable-carmin. When the pears are done, they must be of a nice red color. 1028. Plum-cakes. With ten ounces of flour, three ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, three whole eggs, half an ounce of yeast, and the milk requisite, prepare a raised paste, proceeding as said for that of brioche: bread-paste may also be employed. — When the paste has risen to the degree requi- site , turn it out on the floured table, then roll it out thin to the shape of a square; now spread it on a baking-sheet, make a little rim to the paste, keep it thus for twenty minutes; then butter its surface, over which sprinkle a handful of bitter almonds, chopped and mixed up with a pinch of powder - cinnamon; mask it with black plums cut in two; apply them on the side with the skin on, setting them a little ‘a cheval; sprinkle over sugar, push the cake into a slack oven ; bake it for twenty or twenty-five minutes; when it is taken out, again sprinkle over sugar, let it cool, divide it in long squares of middling-size.475 PASTRY. — PEAR-FLAWN, PLUM-CAKES, MERINGUES.

Put the whites of eggs into a copper-basin with a grain of salt, beat them up with a whip, quite gently in the beginning; augment the celerity of the motion, in proportion as the volume augments : well - whipped whites of eggs must be stiff and smooth ; then gradually add to them the sugar by the aid of a wooden spoon. Introduce a part of this preparation into a bag with funnel (see drawing 342); squeeze it through, in a round shape, on strips of paper. Sprinkle over the ‘meringues’ tine sugar, press them slightly on the centre, in order to efface the point left by the funnel. Range these strips of paper on moistened boards, and bake the ‘meringues’ in a very slack oven : they must be of a fine golden color. When they are taken out of the oven, disengage them from the paper; then, with the aid of a teaspoon, remove the soft part out of each oi the ‘meringues’, which then place on a baking-sheet, applying them on the colored part; let them dry in the well warmed hot-closet for twelve hours : a ‘meringue’ too fresh is not agreeable to taste. When the ‘meringues’ are to be served, they must be left to cool, whereupon fill them with good whipped cream sugared and scented ; then put them together by two and two {see draAving 341), dish them up, in a group, on a folded napkin. 1030.

Apple-‘chosson’. Take a pound of trimmings of puff-paste, divide it into eight or ten equal parts, which roll up to round flats of four inches’ diameter. On the other hand, mince twenty good apples, put them into a saute-pan with a piece of butter, a piece of cinnamon, and two handfuls of raw sugar, or powder-sugar; let them toss quickly, so that the apples boil without breaking them, and their moisture be reduced; then take them off the fire; remove the cinnamon, let the apples cool, and with them, garnish the flats of paste, but only to half their width, and leaving a little free space on the edges; moisten these edges with the paste-brush, then fold the flat upon itself, so as to cover the apples, forming a large ‘rissole’. Press the paste on all round, cut it, channeling it; this done, range the cakes on a baking-sheet, placing them one beside the other, and draw lines on each of these cakes, with the point of a small knife; slightly egg them, bake them in a slack oven; previous to taking them out, sprinkle over fine sugar.

Draw. 352. Dilute the yeast with half a glassful of tepid water ; with this liquid, and half of the flour, prepare a rather stiff dough, which place in a stewpan, the bottom of which is moistened with a little tepid water; cover it, let the dough rise in the hot-closet. On the other hand, gather the flour on the table in a heap, form a hollow in its centre, and in it place the salt, the sugar, two spoonfuls of water, the butter, and three whole eggs; prepare the paste, intro- ducing into it gradually the butter, the eggs, and the flour; work it vigorously with the hands for twelve minutes, by degrees introducing into it the remainder of the eggs : the paste must be soft and smooth.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 480 Then adcl to it the dough; working it again for ten minutes ; then take it up with the hands, cutting it up in little bits, and thus place it in a kitchen-basin ; cover it, let it rise in the temperature of the kitchen; when its volume has augmented to nearly double, turn it out on the floured table, beat it with the hands, folding it up several times, then putting it back again into the basin; four hours after, break it again, and keep it in a cool place, or on ice, for an hour. As soon as the paste has got firm, gather it to a ball on the floured table, place it on a baking-sheet, then flatten it, and pierce its centre through with the hands, so as to form a circle, as regular as possible, by spreading the paste (see draw. 352). With this quantity of paste two circles may be obtained, or even three.

Macaroons of bitter almonds. Pound half a pound of sweet almonds, mixed with a few bitter ones; add to them the white of an egg, then half a pound of pounded sugar; when the mixture is operated, add to it three whites of eggs more, then again half a pound of sugar, but little at a time: the paste must be creamy, and not fall down. Take this paste in little pieces of an equal size, roll them up between both hands to a round shape; this done, range them, at a little dis- tance from one another, on sheets of paper, and moisten them with the wet finger; place the sheets of paper on baking-sheets, and bake the macaroons in a slack oven. 1047. Small nougats with cream. Prepare a nougat-paste (see art. 989) with almonds cut in small dice ; spread the paste thin, taking but little quantities at a time, and arranging it on an oiled baking-sheet; with it, line a score of dariole- moulds the shape of goblets. Trim their borders straight, let them cool, and turn them out, border their aperture with a string of ‘meringue’, which apply against some chopped pistachioes, thus bordering the ‘nougats’ with a green garland. — Fix to each of the ‘nougats’ a little handle of cooked white puff-paste; fill them with whipped cream, flavored with vanilla, and serve. 1048. Travelling-cakes. Work up half a pound of sugar with twelve yolks of eggs, and half the zest of a lemon ; when the preparation is frothy, add to it twelve tablespoonfuls of fresh grated bread-crumb, and ten or twelve whipped whites of eggs.

Light wafers. Work up, in a kitchen-basin, five ounces of butter half-melted, mixing-with it, gradually, six yolks of eggs ; when the preparation is become frothy, add five ounces of flour, a grain of salt, a pinch of sugar; then dilute it with a quarter of an ounce of yeast diluted with a glass of tepid water, or of milk; cover the basin, keep it in a mild temperature. When the paste has risen, let it cool again, and in- corporate with it four or five whipped whites of eggs. Heat a concave wafer-iron (gaufrier), butter it, with a paste-brush, with clarified butter, then put a spoonful of paste on one side only of the ‘gaufrier ; close it and cook the wafer (gaufre) at a slow fire, turning the iron over; when it is dry and of good color, sprinkle it over with fine sugar flavored with vanilla. 1050. Mince-pies. Chop fine two pounds of beef-kidney suet free from skin or sinew; deposit it in a kitchen-basin, mix with it one pound of cooked beef-fillet, trimmed and chopped, two pounds of sour apples, raw, peeled, and cut up into small dice, or else chopped; two pounds of currants, carefully cleansed; one pound of large malaga- raisins without stones and chopped; two pounds of preserved peel of cedrat, of lemon, and of orange, in equal parts, also chopped, or else cut up into very small dice ; adding lastly a pound of raw sugar (cassonade). Mix these ingredients well together, moisten them with half a bottle of brandy, and the juice of several lemons; cover them, keep them in a cool place; leave them to macerate for seven or eight days. For two dozen mince-pies take nine or ten ounces of short-paste, flatten it out thin, and with it line twenty-four round-bottomed tartlet- moulds; garnish the hollow of the paste with a portion of the preparation,THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 486 heaping it rather to a dome; moisten the edge of the paste, with the paste-brush, then cover the preparation with a thin flat of puff-paste, cut round, and with a small hole in the centre. Solder this flat with the paste of the edges, egg it; range the moulds on an iron baking-sheet, bake the tartlets in a slack oven, for twenty-five minutes, covering them with paper, for the paste ought to be thoroughly done. At the moment of serving the mince-pies, infilter into the interior, a few tablespoonfuls of punch-syrup, quite hot, and dish them. 1051. Gingerbread. Place in a kitchen-basin, a pound of flour, five ounces of butter, five ounces of sugar, four tablespoonfuls of powdered ginger, a grain of salt, a gill of hot treacle, three whole eggs ; with the flour and the liquid form a paste, rather firm; distribute this into small portions, roll these to a round shape, of the size of a small nut; range them at intervals over a buttered iron plate, bake them in a slack oven. 1052. Cream-almond-ice. Proportions: a quart of good milk, twelve ounces of sugar, a quarter of sweet, and bitter almonds, half a stick of vanilla, a bit of lemon-zest, and eight yolks of eggs. — Prepare the cream, as is said art. 1054; at the moment when it begins to thicken, add to it the almonds and vanilla, pounded together with a few tablespoonfuls of fresh cream: stir it for a minute on the fire; place it in a kitchen-basin, in order to swing it until it is cold ; add to it the zest, let the cream infuse, until the moment of employing it; then pass it through a sieve, and pour it into the ice-box. 1053. Simple syrup. Simple syrup, that is, without perfume, and cooked to the degree requisite, and sufficient for its preservation, ought to give thirty degrees at the syrup-scale ; in order to prepare this syrup, (two or three quarts),487 SYRUP, CREAM-, & ALMOND-ICES. it suffices to put two pounds of sugar, in lump, into a copper-basin or sugar-pan, to moisten them with a pint and a half of tepid water; set the basin on the lire, skim the liquid; at the first bubbling remove it, and let it cool. I have deemed it requisite to attach to this article, not only the model of a syrup-scale (pese-sirop), which can easily be procured every-where, but also the pro- cess employed for ascertaining, what degree the syrup weighs or measures ; this procedure is one of the most simple; it suffices to pour the syrup into a flagon, nearly fitting it, and then to introduce the instrument into the liquid, and watch the syrup-scale descend. Draw.361. Draw. 362. 1054. Cream-ices. Ices may be perfumed with cream, orange-zest, hazel-nut, almond, Draw. 363. or orange-blossom. 1 will sum up in this article all these preparations, which are founded on the same principles.488 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. In order to prepare vanilla - ice, a stick of vanilla is split down the middle, and cut into two or three pieces. Let a pint of good milk boil; at the first bubbling plunge the vanilla into the liquid, cover the stewpan, and take it off the fire. In the meanwhile, deposit eight yolks of eggs in a kitchen-basin, mix up with them nine ounces of powder-sugar, work the preparation with a spoon; when it is quite frothy, dilute it with the perfumed boiling- milk, pouring it in by degres ; then pour it back into the stewpan, stir it on the fire, for a few minutes, with a spoon, in order to finish thickening the cream; then pass it, through a sieve, into a basin; let it cool, stirring it from time to time; then pour it into the ice- box, and let it freeze: this preparation forms the basis of all cooked cream-ices. In order to prepare coffee-ice, it is sufficient to roast the coffee- berries just as for grinding them, that is, until the moment, when they show a kind of oily moisture; at this degree, put them into a stew- pan, and pour the boiling liquid over the coffee; cover the vessel, in order to let the liquid infuse for a quarter of an hour. With this infusion, passed through a sieve, prepare the cream, proceeding as indicated above. In order to prepare an ice - preparation with hazel-nut, almond, or walnut, the nuts must be pounded with a little water, then thrown into boiling milk. When the milk is infused, pass the liquid through a sieve, and with it, dilute the preparation of eggs, in order to get ready the cream. — For these kinds of cream, it is advisable always to add a little piece of vanilla, which advantageously relieves the taste of almonds or hazel-nuts. In order to prepare ice flavored with fresh orange-blossoms, it is • sufficient to plunge these blossoms into the cooked cream, prepared according to the method prescribed above; let them infuse for ten or fifteen minutes, then pass the cream through a sieve, and let it freeze. As for the method of freezing these different creams, there is no difference from the one adopted for fruit-ices.PREPARING CREAM-ICES, CLARIFYING SYRUP. 489 1055. Clarifying the syrup. Put two pounds of sugar, in lump, into a copper-basin, moisten it with a quart of cold water; when the sugar is dissolved, mix into the liquid a white of egg slightly whipped, then mixed with a gill of cold water, and the juice of one lemon. Set the sugar on a slow fire, whip it for five minutes ; at the first bubbling remove it to the side of the fire, mix into it the juice of another lemon; ten minutes after, pass it, let it reduce to the degree desired. 1056. Cream-ice, with chestnuts. Proportions: one quart of good milk, twelve ounces of sugar, seven yolks of eggs, a stick of vanilla, fifteen ounces of chestnuts. — Split the chestnuts in order to roast them; pluck them, pound them, lighten them with syrup, and pass them through a sieve; prepare the cream (see art. 1054), add to it the vanilla; then dilute the chestnut-puree with this cream, swing the preparation till it is cold; pass it then through a tammy, and let it freeze. 1057. Cream-ice, with filberts. Proportions: one quart of simple cream, twelve ounces of sugar, a quarter of a pound of filberts, a stick of vanilla, and eight yolks of eggs. — Roast the filberts, and keep them warm. Boil to caramel (as for a ‘nougat’ art. 988), three ounces of sugar; add to it the filberts, operate the mixture, pour the preparation on a lightly oiled baking-sheet, in order to let it cool; pound it coarsely. Prepare the cream with the eggs and the remainder of the sugar; when it is thickened, add to it the pounded ‘nougat’, pour it into a kitchen-basin, let it cool until the moment of employing it; then pass it through a sieve, and let it freeze. 1058. Cream-ice, with chocolate. Proportions: one quart of good milk, twelve ounces of sugar, half a pound of chocolate, a stick of vanilla, and seven yolks of eggs.490 TI-IE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. — Let the chocolate soften at the entrance of the oven, dilute it with a fifth of the tepid cream; prepare now the cream, with the sugar, and the eggs ; as soon as it is thickened, add to it the vanilla; then dilute the chocolate with this cream, let it cool, pass it through a sieve, and let it freeze. 1059. Cream-ice, with rice. Proportions: good milk, a pint and a half; milk of sweet and hitter almonds, two gills and a half; sugar, twelve ounces; rice, three ounces; and some orange and lemon-zest. — Boil the rice in plenty of water, till quite tender ; drain it on a sieve, place it in a kitchen-basin, moisten it with three gills of syrup flavored with vanilla at twenty-five degrees; let it macerate for four hours. Prepare the cream with the almond-milk, the sugar, and the eggs; when it is boiled, put it into another basin, and swing it until it is cold; add to it a little orange-zest, pass it through a sieve, and let it freeze; when the ice is thickened well, and firm, add to it the rice, after having drained its syrup; finish the ice, proceeding according to the common method. 1060. Cream-ice, Naples-way. Proportions: three gills of double cream, a pint and a half of syrup at twenty-five degrees, fifteen yolks of eggs, and the zest of an orange. — Place the yolks of eggs in a stewpan, dilute them gradually with the boiling syrup, quickly whipping them, until the preparation be nearly cold ; then add to it the zest, in order to let it infuse for twenty minutes ; when it is quite cold, pass it through the sieve, let it freeze in the ice-box, proceeding according to the common method. — These ices may be prepared with any extract whatever. 1061. Raw cream-ice, with strawberries. Proportions : a pint of raw-cream, a pint of puree of fresh straw- berries, twelve ounces of sugar, and a stick of vanilla. Pound the vanilla together with the sugar, which then add to the strawberry-puree,491 CREAM-, COFFEE-, PINE-APPLE-, ICES. let it melt; add to it the cream, pass the preparation through a sieve into a kitchen-basin5 let it freeze, proceeding by the general rules. 1062. Coffee-ice. Let six ounces of coffee roast to the degree when the berries are covered with a kind of oily moisture; then pour them into four gills of milk kept warm ; add to the liquid twelve ounces of cut sugar ; cover the stewpan, take it off the fire, let the infusion nearly cool. Place in a kitchen - basin eight yolks of eggs; dilute them with four gills of milk; add the infusion, then pass the liquid, through a sieve, into a stewpan; stir it on the fire, until the moment when starting to ebullition ; the cream should then prove thickened ; pour it into a basin, and let it cool. Pack up an ice-box in a bucket, with pounded and salted ice. Let the cream freeze, proceeding according to the common method. Yet must it not be forgotten, that an ice, the more it is worked, the finer and the more elastic it will be. At serving-time, dish the ice on a napkin. 1063. Ice of green asparagus. Take twelve or fifteen ounces of green, and fresh asparagus ; it is manifest that only its tender parts must be taken, in order to cut them up in pieces the length of half an inch ; boil them in salted water in a sugar-pan, keeping them firm ; then pound them, and pass them through a sieve; dilute this puree with a quart of syrup at thirty degrees, with vanilla, but cold ; add to it two gills of good raw cream ; pass it through a tammy, let it freeze, according to the common method. — The ice must be of a fine pistachio-color ; if it were pale, there might be mixed up with it a little spinach-green, lightened with cold syrup. 1064. Pine-apple ice. Proportions: eight gills of syrup at thirty-two degrees, twelve ounces of pine-apple pulp, a little zest, and the juice of an orange.492 TIIE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Trim the pine-apple, cut its pulp, pound, and put it into a glazed basin ; dilute it with the syrup, add the zest and orange-juice, and bring it to the degree requisite; pass it through a fine sieve : it must give twenty-two degrees, at the syrup-scale ; let the ice freeze in the ice-box, proceeding according to the common rules. 1065. Water-ice. Proportions : a quart of syrup at twenty-five degrees, fifteen yolks of eggs, and a stick of vanilla. — Infuse the vanilla in the boiling syrup; with this syrup then lighten the yolks, by degrees, and whipping them; pass the preparation through a sieve into a stewpan, or copper-basin; whip it for a few minutes on the fire, without allowing it to boil; pour it into another basin, and whip it again till it is cold; let it freeze then in the ice-box. 1066. Peacli-ice. Choose a few ripe peaches, peel them, stone them, pass their pulp then through a sieve ; measure two glassfuls of this puree, pour it into a kitchen-basin, mix into it two glassfuls of powder-sugar flavored with vanilla; then dilute the preparation with a glassful and a half of cold water ; add to it the juice of a lemon, and of three oranges. After the lapse of ten minutes, pass the preparation through a fine sieve; try, if it is of the degree requisite, in order to rectify it if necessary ; then let it freeze according to the common method, until the ice is quite smooth and firm ; then gradually mix into it half a gill of maraschino, mixed with a few drops of carmin, and also with two spoon- fuls of the preparation. Twenty minutes after, the ice must have frozen to the degree requisite; then take it up with a spoon, dish it up, in a rock-sliape, on a napkin. 1067. Apple-ice. Cut in quarters fifteen good Calville-apples, peel them, put them into a stewpan with a glassful of water, half a stick of vanilla, and twoWATER-, PEACH-, APPLE-, STRAWBERRY-, APRICOT-, ICES. 493 tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar; boil them on a quick tire, keeping the stewpan covered ; then pass them through a fine sieve ; dilute this puree with two glassfuls of syrup at thirty degress ; add the juice of three oranges, that of three lemons, and a little zest; let it freeze according to the common method. 1068. Strawberry-ice. Pass, through a sieve, fresh wood-strawberries. Pour into a glazed . earthen-ware basin two glassfuls of this puree, mix into it two glassfuls of powder - sugar ; add to it half the zest, the juice of two oranges, and three lemons, then half a glassful of water. A quarter of an hour after, pass the preparation through a fine sieve, try a part of it in the ice-box, in order to judge, if the preparation is at the degree requisite ; rectify it, if necessary, then let it freeze according to the common method. On the other hand, choose a few dozen fine strawberries, put them into a mould, sprinkle over them fine sugar, keep them on salted ice; leave them packed, until they have got firm. At serving-time, take the ice up with a spoon, dish it up in a rock- shape, on a cold dish, covered with a napkin ; sprinkle over the glazed strawberries. 1069. Apricot-ice. Proportions: a pint and a half of syrup of thirty degrees (see draw. 361,362), the same of fruit-puree, the juice of two oranges, two tablespoonfuls of sugar flavored with vanilla, two tablespoonfuls of milk of bitter almonds, and zest. Choose the fruit very ripe, fresh and of a fine flavor, pass it through a sieve; mix the puree up with the syrup, the almond-milk, and the orange- juice ; pass the preparation through a tammy, give it twenty-two degrees at the syrup-scale, and let it freeze. —As the syrup-scale gives but imper- fectly the degrees of the sugar in purees, it is convenient in this case to put a spoonful of the preparation into the ice-box, in order to be better able to judge of its consistence ; it can then be rectified with syrup, of more or less consistence, according as the ice proves thick or thin.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 494 1070. Melon-ice. Proportions: a pint and a half of sugar at thirty degrees, the same of melon-puree, the juice of an orange and two lemons, a bit of orange-zest, a few drops of orange-flower-water, and two tablespoonfuls of kirsch. Cut into slices a good melon, grate or pass the pulp through a sieve; mix the puree up with the syrup, the lemon and orange-juice, the zest and the orange-flower - water; pass the preparation through a tammy: it must weigh twenty-two degrees at the syrup-scale (see draw. 362, 363); let it freeze; introduce into it the kirsch, as soon as the ice has got creamy and firm. 1071. Raspberry‘ice. Proportions: six gills of syrup at thirty-two degrees, six or seven gills of raspberry-puree, the juice of two oranges, a bit of zest. Pass the raspberries through a sieve, add to them the orange-juice, the vanilla-syrup, and the zest: the preparation should weigh twenty-three degrees at the syrup-scale : pass it through a tammy, into the ice-box, and let it freeze. Strawberry-, currant-, cherry-, grenadine-, and generally all the red-colored ices, can be managed according to the same method, taking- care to augment or diminish the juice of lemon or orange, according to the natural acidity of the fruit. 1072. Currant-ice. Grain red-currants, chosen very fresh and ripe; press their juice out through a cloth ; for one quart of juice, take a pint and a half of very consistent syrup ; add also the zest and the juice of an orange, pass the preparation through a sieve; give it twenty-two degrees at the syrup- scale (see draw. 361, 362), and let it freeze- 1073. Ice-cheese. Iced cheeses simply are composed of fruit, or cream-ices, but of various shade and species ; these ices are finished to the degree requisite,MELON-. RASPBERRY-, CURRANT-, ICES ; ICE-CHEESE, SORBETS. 495 and then set in cheese-moulds, that is, in moulds of conical form, either plain or channeled, but with movable compartments;• these compartments serve for separating the different ingredients the cheese is composed of. In order to prepare an ice-cheese, in the first place the mould must be packed up with salted ice, then the ices are introduced, species by species, into each of the compartments allotted thereto ; if no mould with compartments should be at disposal, the various ices may be ranged in the mould, by horizontal layers, in alternate shades. If the mould is provided with com- partments, the movables sides are removed as soon as the mould is tilled, disengaging them with the aid of a warmed knife ; the ice is then pressed close, so as to leave no free space in the interior; the mouth of the mould is covered, firstly with a large round of paper, then with its lid, closing it up hermetically; the mould is then completely masked with pounded and salted ice, this ice is covered with a cloth, and the cheese is kept thus for two hours ; particular care must be taken, that the water in the bucket, coming from the melting of the ice, never comes up to the height of the mould. At serving-time, the mould is dipped into water, wiped, and the ice- cheese is turned out on a folded napkin. 1074. ‘Sorbets’, with champagne. Sorbets are a sort of thin ices (mciigres), that is: light, not much set, nor very consistent; they are served in ice-glasses ; they are often served at dinner, as Roman punch is, before or after the roast. Proportions: a pint of syrup, half a bottle of champagne, the juice of two oranges and one lemon, and various zests. Lighten the syrup with half of the wine, and the lemon- and orange-juice ; infuse the zests for a quarter of an hour, pass the preparation through a sieve, give it eighteen degrees at the syrup-scale, let it freeze in the ice-box, work- ing it with the spattle ; when the ice has set, gradually add to it the remainder of the champagne, mixed with a little syrup.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 496 Alter this same method may be prepared, ‘sorbets’ with kirsch, with kiimmel, with madeira, with malaga, etc. 1075. Pine-apple ‘sorbet’. Proportions : a pint of pine-apple-syrup at thirty-two degrees, the juice of four oranges and one lemon, a little zest, and two gills of champagne. Prepare some pine-apple-ice, giving eighteen degrees at the syrup- scale ; when it is smooth and firm, gradually add to it the champagne, mixed with a little syrup ; ten minutes after, serve the ‘sorbet’. 1076. Marascliino-spongade. Spongade (spongata) is a preparation of Italian origin. It is a confection made indifferently with either cream or fruit. Its perfect lightness depends especially on its management: ‘spongade’ is served in glasses, as iced punch. Proportions : a quart of double cream, one gill of whites of eggs, ten ounces of sugar, two gills of maraschino. Let the sugar melt with the cold cream, add to it the whites of eggs not whipped, and the maraschino ; then pass the preparation through a sieve twice, then pour it into the ice-box, which turn on the ice for a few minutes, kept covered; then uncover it, and turn it, with the left hand slipping the spattle between the sides and the bottom, in order to disengage the adhering parts; but immediately, when the preparation begins to thicken, leave off turning the ice-box with the hand, managing this movement with the spattle, applying it firmly against the side, on one side only going down to the very bottom. The effect of the spattle suffices to let the ice-box turn; but the spattle must act on the mass from the top to the bottom, and when taken up must lift the lid in such a manner, as to let it absorb as much air as possible. When the cream has augmented to double its volume, is smooth and light, then introduce into it the maraschino mixed up with a little syrup ; introduce it, by degrees only without leaving off the work ; then serve the ‘spongade’ in ice-glasses.BEVERAGES. — ICE, SORBET, SPONGADE. 497 1077. Chocolate -‘spongade’. Proportions: four gills of double cream, nine ounces of vanilla- chocolate, nine ounces of sugar, three gills of water, and one gill of whites of eggs ; let the chocolate melt, dilute it with water, add to it the whites of eggs ; pass the preparation twice through a tine sieve ; let it freeze, and finish the preparation, as for maraschino-‘spongade7 (see art. 1076). 1078. Peach-‘spongade’. Proportions : five gills of syrup at thirty-eight degrees, five gills of puree of raw peaches, two tablespoonfuls of maraschino, and one gill of whites of eggs not whipped. Place the peaches in a basin, dilute them with the whites of eggs and the syrup, pass the preparation through a tammy, let it freeze, pro- ceeding as said, art. 1076. — Last of all, introduce into it the maraschino; mixed with a little syrup, but by degrees,only. 1079. Currant-<granites\ ‘Granites7 are a kind of ‘sorbets7, much in use in Italy, and also in France ; they are prepared only with light syrup and the juice of various fruit, such as currant, raspberry, pine-apple, orange, lemon, etc. Proportions: six gills of syrup at twenty degrees, six gills of currant-juice, the juice of two oranges, and a few bits of zest. — Mix the fruit-juice up with the syrup, the orange-juice, and the zest; the pre- paration should give fourteen or fifteen degrees at the syrup-scale ; pass it through a sieve, then pour it into an ice-box, with half the usual portion of salt; let the liquid freeze or set (frapper), turning the ice-box only from time to time; after the lapse of a few minutes, disengage the part adhering to the sides ; as soon as the composition begins to set, it passes instantly to the condition of a ‘granite7, that is, it yields a composition of grainy, rough ice; this being the point, where ‘granite7 differs from all other ice-preparations. If the ‘granites7 are not served immediately, all the water of the bucket must be drained, and the ice-box covered. 32THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 498 1080. Orgeat-granite. Take a few gills of almond-milk, sweeten it with sugar, or syrup, at thirty-two degrees, flavored with vanilla, so as to give the liquid fourteen or fifteen degrees at the syrup-scale; let it freeze, proceeding as said above. 1081.

Prepare some good coffee with water ; let it cool, mix it up with the same volume of cold cream; sweeten the preparation a little more than to make it liquid ; pour it into a packed ice-box, but with only half the usual quantity of ice; cover it, and keep it thus for ten minutes ; then disengage the parts adhering to the sides, cover the ice-box again ; after the lapse of twenty minutes, begin the operation again, shut the ice-box; twenty minutes after, slightly work the preparation, and pour it into cups or glasses : it must be slightly thickened, without being compact. 1082. Iced punch with fruits. Proportions: a quart of syrup of apples, pears, and currants, mixed together in equal parts, the juice of four oranges, a bit of zest, half a gill of vanilla-syrup, half a gill of rum, half a gill of kirsch, and five whites of Italian ‘meringue’, that is, prepared with warm syrup. Compose an ice-preparation, with the fruit-syrups, the juice of oranges, and the zest; give it twenty degrees at the syrup-scale; pass it through a sieve, let it freeze. When the ice has set, add to it the ‘meringue’; work it with the spattle for ten minutes ; then introduce into it, gradually, the liqueurs mixed with a little syrup. — This punch must be served, as soon as possible, when finished. 1083. Hot-punch. Put into a copper-pan a pound of crushed loaf-sugar, which moisten with two gills of kirsch, another of rum, and a little cognac; set the liquid alight, let it burn till the sugar be dissolved, then add a bottle ot champagne, the juice of an orange, and half a pine-apple in slices. Heat the punch previous to serving.499 BEVERAGES. - GRANITE, PUNCH, ICED-CHAMPAGNE. 1084. Iced-champagne. I have observed long since, that champagne is but rarely served in the condition requisite. This is the motive, that has determined me to introduce this subject into this book, in order to correct an error, the first result of which is, to prejudice an appreciated and excellent product. Champagne must always be served iced, never otherwise; it may be iced to different degrees, this being a matter of taste, but the essential thing is that it be iced to some degree. In order to pack, or ice the champagne, the bottles must be placed in a bucket or pail, the bottom of which is masked with a layer of pounded and salted ice, up to three- fourths of its height; the proportion of salt to ice is one fourth ; that is, four pounds of ice require one pound of crushed kitchen-salt. The time necessary to ice the wine is, forty minutes. In these conditions the champagne is penetrated by the cold without being con- gealed ; these are the conditions, in which it should be taken. The Russians, in general, drink their champagne iced, to the degree when all the aqueous parts of the wine are congealed: this proceeding necessarily augments the strength of the liquid, yet is far from rendering it better ; it is a refinement, better left to the whims of the fanciful; as wine iced to excess, can be no longer either agreeable, or wholesome. The thing to be sought after, is a cold, but not excessive temperature. If the wine is iced to the simple degree without congealing it, the bottles may remain corked up in the bucket: in the contrary case, if the wine is to be partly congealed, the bottles must be uncorked ten minutes after being brought on ice. In order to congeal the wine, it is sufficient to augment the quantity of salt, and to pack it longer. 32*500 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-HOOK. II the iced wine is meant to be placed on the table, a thing of frequent occurrence, the bottles must be packed in Ruolz-pails set on a tray. In this case, the neck of the bottles must be clothed with a leather- case, to protect the hands of those, who pour the wine out. 1085. Imperial iced-punch. Proportions: a pint and a half of vanilla-syrup, half of a fresh middling-sized pine-apple, the juice of four oranges and two lemons, a little zest of both; mace; half a gill of cream of noyau, the same of kirsch, the same of cura§ao, and two gills of champagne ; five whites of Italian- ‘meringue’ preparation. Pound the pine-apple, let it infuse in the syrup for an hour; then add the zests, the mace, and last of all, the orange- and lemon-juice; pass the preparation through a tammy, give it twenty-two degrees at the syrup-scale, let the ice set in the ice-box; when it is quite smooth, intro- duce into it the ‘meringue’; let it settle for ten minutes, then add to it (gradually) the liqueurs, mixed with a little syrup. 1086. Cold-punch. Put into a stewpan half a pound of sugar, moisten it with a glassful of water ; as soon as the sugar is dissolved, let the liquid boil for two minutes, then take it off the fire ; when it is cold, mix into it the zest of half a lemon, and that of an orange ; add to it half a gill of good brandy, and the same of tea-infusion, as well as a few spoonfuls of syrup or juice of pine-apple; ten minutes after, pass the liquid, through a fine sieve, into another vessel; keep it on the ice for half an hour previous to serving it. 1087. Milk-punch. Put a pound of sugar in lump, into a kitchen-basin, moisten it with a glass of hot water, in order to make it dissolve, add a half-zest of lemon, and one of orange, or else a few drops of essence; the juice of three lemons, a piece of cinnamon, a few cloves, and grains of coriander;501 ICED-SODA, HOT AND COLD PUNCH, ORANGEADE, &c. a gill of rum; as much of arrack, the same of milk, the same of tea- infusion. Filter the liquid, let it ice, and serve it in glasses. 1088. Raspberry-water. Bruise a few handfuls of very fresh raspberries, mix up with them a handful of powder-sugar, throw them on a sieve, in order to collect their juice ; add to this juice a bit of lemon- and orange-zest, as well as six ounces of lump-sugar moistened with water; then dilute the prepara- tion with the water requisite, pass it through a sieve, pour it into a decanter, which keep on ice for an hour. 1089. Iced-soda. Put into a glazed basin, two glassfuls of currant-syrup ; dilute it with two or three bottles of very cold selzer or soda water, add a few small quite clean pieces of natural ice, and serve. 1090. Orangeade. Cut up six oranges, dividing each of them in two ; press their juice out on a sieve, placed over an enameled basin; add to this juice the zest of an orange, and half a pound of crushed loaf-sugar, previously moistened with cold water; when the sugar is dissolved, add cold water, in order to bring it to the requisite degree of sweetness ; then pass it through a cloth, pour it into a decanter, which keep on ice for an hour. 1091. Prince Albert’s bishop. Break in pieces a pound of sugar, which put into a china-bowl, with the juice of three oranges, and a little water, thus dissolving the sugar. Add the zest of two green oranges, as well as a bottle of good claret, infuse the liquid for half an hour, then pass it through a sieve. 1092. Cardinal. Put a pound of loaf-sugar into a china-bowl, moisten with a glass of cold water, thus dissolving it, then add a bottle of Rhine-wine, andTHE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY- BOOK. 502 half a bottle of champagne, a few blades of orange- or lemon-zest, as Avell as the juice of two oranges ; pass the liquid through a cloth, let it cool on plain ice previous to serving it. 1093. Raspberry-drink. Pour into an ice-box a quart of raspberry-juice already sweetened, giving by the syrup-scale twenty degrees ; pack the ice-box slightly with ice, merely to grain the preparation; which stir with a spoon, from time to time, yet without working it; five minutes previous to serving it. mix into it a bottle of good claret. Serve this drink in a china- or crystal vessel. 1094. Apple-jelly in small glasses. Fruit-jellies, meant to be served as a compote, or garnish of a com- pote, will be far best preserved in jelly-glasses of the kind represented by the drawing 366 ; in these conditions the jelly may be turned out on the centre of a compote-dish ; if the jelly is well prepared, it ought to maintain itself upright, and in shape ; then, if a pretty circle of fruits is ranged all round the jelly, a compote of distinguished appearance is obtained. Choose apples exactly ripe, but a little acid; renettas and calvilles are not so suitable, as other sorts of inferior quality. Divide the apples into quarters, mince them without peeling them; place them in a well tinned stewpan, moisten them, just to cover, with warm water; cover the stewpan, set it on the fire; let the liquid boil from twelve to fifteen minutes, that is, until the moment when the apples begin to melt. Place a sieve on a large kitchen-basin, pour the apples, as well as the liquid, on the sieve; then filter the juice. Weigh the apple-juice, put it into a copper-basin, add to it three fourths of its weight of good sugar, broken or cut into small pieces; set the basin on the fire, carefully skim the jelly, let it boil for ten or twelve minutes ; at this degree, if the skimmer is dipped into the jelly, this should coat the metal, and fall in beads; then remove the jelly back to the side of the fire, skim it again, mix into it half a stick of vanilla, andRASPBERRY-DRINK, APPLE-, AND CURRANT-JELLY. 503 a few drops of liquid carmin. A few minutes after, take the jelly with a deep spoon, and with it, fill the glasses, previously warmed, in the hot- closet. Range these glasses on a baking-sheet, keep them in the tem- perature of the kitchen, for twenty-four hours, then cover them down. In order to cover the glasses, firstly on the jelly must be laid a round of paper, cut of the dimension of the aperture, and clipped into brandy. Cut then some rounds of paper, larger than the jelly- glasses ; moisten the rim of each glass with dissolved gum, apply the paper to it, pressing it down. When the gum has well dried, cut the paper at a level with the rim of the vessel. Jellies in general must be kept in a dry place, well sheltered from all humidity. 1095. Currant-jelly in large jars. Choose the currants red, but not over-ripe ; remove the berries from the stalks ; weigh them, put them into an untinned copper-basin ; mix into them two pounds of sugar, to each pound of fruit; let the sugar and the fruits macerate for one hour, stirring them from time to time; set the basin on a fire, give the liquid four or five minutes’ ebullition, and pour it, together with the fruit, on a sieve, placed over a kitchen-basin. The jelly passes limpid, and is set, as soon as it has cooled. 1096. Orangeade with wine. Grate on sugar the zest of two oranges, rasp this sugar with a knife, then put it into a china-bowl, add the juice of four oranges, half a pint of syrup, being cold and rather concentrated, and half a bottle of white- wine. Pass the liquid through a cloth, let it thoroughly cool.504 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 1097. Compote of dried prunes. Wash the prunes in cold water, place them in a stewpan, largely moisten them with water, let the liquid boil, then remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire. A quarter of an hour after, drain the prunes on a sieve, put them back into the stewpan, with a little white or red wine, a bit of zest, a little sugar, and a little water; let the liquid boil, cover the stewpan, and boil the prunes, until the syrup is of a light consistence; pour the compote then into a kitchen - basin; let it cool, and dish it up. 1098. Compote of peaches. Split up the middle seven or eight peaches, stone them, plunge them into boiling water ; as soon as their skin disengages, peel them, and range them in a kitchen - basin; cover them with syrup flavored with vanilla, warm, and kept rather consistent; when the syrup is cold, dish the peaches in a circle, pour over the syrup. 1099. Compote of whole apricots. Peel fifteen whole apricots, not *too ripe, plunge them into boiling water; as soon as they are slightly softened, drain them, range them in a kitchen-basin. — Pour half a glassful of their cooking liquor into a sugar-pan, mix up with it nine ounces of cut sugar; let the liquid boil, until the syrup is consistent, then pour it on the apricots; let the compote cool, previous to dishing it. 1100. Compote of red pears. Cut in two five or six good pears, peel them, remove their cores; place them in an untinned sugar-pan, moisten them with water, cover, and let them half-boil; then add to them a few handfuls of sugar, and a few drops of dissolved cochineal, or vegetable carmin; finish boiling the pears, then drain off their syrup, and let it reduce to the degree requisite; then pour it on the pears, passing it through a sieve. Serve the compote cold.COMPOTES: PEACH, APRICOT, PEAR, APPLE, CHERRY, PLUM, &c. 505 1101. Compote of rennet-apples. Cut six rennet-apples, dividing each of them in two ; remove the cores with the aid of a vegetable-scooper, peel them, rub them with half a lemon ; this done, plunge them into cold water. Boil some water, with a pinch of sugar, and the juice of a lemon; plunge the apples into the liquid, and remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire, so as to cook the apples without letting the water boil fast: for certain qualities of apples, the water ought not even to boil. As soon as the apples are done, drain, and range them in a kitchen- basin ; immediately cover them with syrup at twenty degrees ; add to them a little zest. One hour after, dish the apples in a circle ; add a little sugar to the syrup, reduce it to twenty-eight degrees, let it cool, and pour it on the apples. 1102. Compote of cherries. Pluck the stalks off a few dozen sour cherries. — Put into a sugar- pan half a pound of sugar, and a little water ; let it boil till very thick (36 degrees), then add to it the cherries, which boil on a brisk fire for two minutes only; immediately pour the compote into a kitchen-basin, and let it cool; then drain off the syrup, take a part of it, add to it a little sugar, and let it reduce, until it be again of a good consistence (30 degrees) ; then pour it on the cherries ; when cold, dish the compote. 1103. Compote of black-plums. * Peel raw, two dozen plums, without stoning them ; plunge them into boiling water, boil them for two minutes, then drain, and range them in a kitchen-basin ; sprinkle over them powder-sugar, an hour after dish the compote. 1104. Compote of ‘mirabelles’, (yellow or egg-plums). Pluck the stems off a few dozen good hnirabelle’ plums, put them into a skillet with powder-sugar, and a few tablespoonfuls of tepid water; boil the mirabelles for a few minutes on a brisk fire, and kept covered;THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 506 then pour them into a kitchen-basin, and immediately they are cold serve them in a compote-dish. 1105. Apricot-marmalade. Choose the apricots quite ripe; stone, and pass them through a sieve: weigh three pounds of the puree, place it in a copper-basin, mix into it two pounds of pounded sugar ; set the basin on the fire, let the marma- lade reduce without leaving it, until it coats well the spoon, and falls in large drops, add some blanched 'almonds (kernels) of the apricots; then take it off the fire, and pour it into warmed glasses. 1106. Black-plum marmalade, or jam. Choose the plums very ripe; scald them, or peel them raw, the latter being preferable; stone them, weigh the fruit, mix them in a copper- basin with a quarter their weight of powder-sugar; let this sugar dissolve off the fire; boil the preserve, stirring it with a spoon, till it is at 33 degrees; then take it off the fire, in order to pour it into glass- or wedgewood-pots, and let if cool.* 1107. Quince-cheese-paste. Procure the fruit, when very ripe, wipe it well; plunge into boiling water, boil the liquid, keeping the vessel covered, till the quinces are tender; take them out, one by one, and scrape off the pulp with a knife leaving only the stalk of the fruit. Pass the pulp through a sieve, press close, mix up, in a stewpan, with three-fourths of its weight of pounded sugar; reduce the preparation to the consistence of a firm compact marmalade. Now pour this preparation on a baking-sheet with upstand- ing rim, spreading it in layers half an inch thick; smoothe the surface with the blade of a knife, let it dry in the warm-closet, till the paste can # The degree of coating (la nappe) is seen to be attained, if, when the spoon is dipped into the marmalade, and immediately removed again, the marmalade masks, or coats the spoon with a thin layer, and falls in large drops.507 COMPOTES, JAMS, LIQUEURS. be detached from the baking-sheet, and managed well; sprinkle over powder-sugar, turn it over on paper. Let it dry in contact of warm air, then cut it up. 1108. Fruits in brandy. For this purpose may be taken sour cherries, black plums, green- gages, mirabelles, whole apricots, peaches, and quinces. As for cherries, their stalks are removed, then the fruit is placed in a vessel, with cinnamon and cloves ; moistened to cover with good brandy ; the vessel is covered, and the fruit left to macerate for a few weeks, in a place exposed to the sun. Then drain off the brandy, and mix with it half a pound of sugar in syrup to each quart of brandy. As for plums, they must be pricked, down to the stones, with the prongs of a fork; after blanching them very slightly in boiling water, then let them soak in cold water for a few hours, then drain, put them into a kitchen - basin, and cover them with light syrup. Twelve hours after, make the syrup boil, adding to it a little sugar, pour it again on the fruit; the next day repeat this operation, then drain the fruit, and range them in a jug (bocal), cover them with cold syrup flavored with vanilla, at thirty degrees, mixed with an equal quantity of brandy. The method of procedure is the same for peaches, and apricots, which must be chosen of middling-size, and not too ripe. The quinces must be cut in quarters ; peel them, remove the hard parts near the core, then boil them in water mixed with a little citric- acid, keeping the stewpan covered. When they are done, let them soak in cold water for a few hours, then place them in sugar, proceeding as indicated for plums. 1109. Syrup of raspberry-vinegar. Let ferment a quart of raspberry-juice, passed through a sieve. — Put into a copper-basin, two pounds of sugar, moisten it with a glassful of water, and a glassful of vinegar; when the sugar has dissol- ved, boil it to 33 degrees; then add to it the raspberry-juice, and boil508 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. the syrup to 32 degrees, carefully skimming it, while boiling. Let it cool, and pour it into a bottle ; when the syrup has quite cooled, cork the bottles. 1110. Black-currant ratafia. Choose the black-currant berries just ripe, remove their stalks: weigh four pounds of berries ; crush, and deposit them in a glass-jug, moisten them with two quarts of brandy at 22 degrees ; add to them a bit of cinnamon, a few black-currant leaves, and a bit of lemon- zest ; close the mouth of the jug, and expose it to the sun for six weeks; then drain off the liquid, filter it, and mix up with it four pounds of crushed loaf-sugar; when the sugar has dissolved, bottle the liqueur. 1111. Nut-liqueur. Put into a jug eight or ten green nuts, cover them with a quart of brandy at 22 degrees ; close the jug, expose it to the sun for twenty days, then mix into the liquid a pound of crushed loaf-sugar; twenty- days after, filter the liqueur, and shut it up in bottles. — This liqueur is both digestive and stomachic. 1112. Stomachic liqueur. Pour into a jug {bocal) a quart of brandy at twenty-two degrees, add to it a pound of crushed loaf-sugar, as well as a whole orange and a whole lemon; cover the jug, expose it to the sun for twenty days; then remove the orange and lemon, and twenty days after, bring the liqueur into another jug, decanting it. Then shut it up in bottles, which carefully cork.PUBLICATIONS OP THE AUTHOR. LONGMANS, GREEN, AND COMPANY, PUBLISHERS. I. ARTISTIC COOKERY : — a large and splendid volume in quarto, with eighty separate copper-plate engravings: — price of the volume bound, two guineas. This book is manifestly stamped with the character of an important work, more considerable than any of those published hitherto on cookeiy ; by its elegance and luxury of style, it has its appropriate place in the libraries of the nobility. Accomplished hosts, experienced cooks, even mistresses of families, may equally derive instruction from its manifold resources ; representing, as it does, within its comprehensive range, all branches of the culinary art, with a copiousness unprecedented, and with incontestable precision. It is, in fact, the first work of the kind, which, while taking its own stand on the most elevated point of view, has nevertheless in some degree succeeded in making culinary science popular, while rendering it more intelligible, and easier of practical execution, by methodical descriptions, all of which are thoroughly sustained and proved by illustrations of the most perfect exactitude: this is a merit that admits of easy verification.THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 510 lhe engravings of this book, indeed, are, both in their abundance, and variety, remarkable ; but wliat gives them a yet greater interest, is this, that they are for the most part drawn from subjects actually carried into execution. To the technical drawings, too, are attached, in rich variety, a series of both sea and fresh-water fish; selected from among the species, the most remarkable, both of the old continent, and of the new hemisphere; these fish are all engraved, moreover, either after nature, or from photographs. Outside its culinary arrangement, the ‘Artistic Cookery’ comprises a collection of authentic bills of fare, proceeding from all the sovereign houses of Europe ; offering thus the most complete variety, and at the same time a special and peculiar interest. In another part of the work, the Service of the Table, after the modern methods, is to be found set forth in most complete development. II. COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY: — a, stout volume, in large octavo, containing more than 300 large drawings carved on wood : an engraved frontispice, and two copper-plate: — price of the volume, bound, a pound sterling, £, 1. This book is a model of originality, rich both in illustration and instruction. If not equaling the high importance of the first work, it is notwithstanding, neither less remarkable, nor yet less interesting: within its range it comprehends examples representing every school, and brings to clearest light the most modern methods ; it treats, with the greatest exactitude, the national dishes of all countries, those, at least, which are found, in each, most worth attention; the receipts, which it contains, have all been drawn from the best sources, and are the result of a most persevering study of the diverse methods of procedure, more or less practised every-where: in fact, this book is a sort of universal511 PUBLICATIONS OF THE AUTHOR. encyclopaedia, full of interest for all who will be at the pains to study it in detail: its merit, above all, consists in being- at once new and true. The numerous designs attached to the chief articles, in order better to explain their application, are of a finish irreproachable, at once precise and elegant: just as the rules and formulas of the preceding- work belong to a different order of ideas, even so the drawings of this latter have been treated from a point of view quite different: the author has not been content with copying even from himself, he has preferred producing something new. To this book is also subjoined a series of authentic bills of fare, served in all countries both of Europe and the new world : the interest, attaching to this portion of the work, can escape no one’s observation. III. 1HE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK: an octavo volume, with 367 illustrative drawings, an engraved frontispice, and two of tables arranged. This work, in style more simple, more minute, and more detailed, than either of the preceding, is calculated to become the guide of all modest households, where the labors of the kitchen are carried on within restricted limits, grounded on economy, at once, and simplification of the methods of procedure. The radical defect of most books of cookery, especially of those intended for the middle, burgher-class, is that of not having taken sufficiently into account the fit subjects for illustration, with respect both to the preparation and the dishing- of the viands, and to the arrangement of the dishes brought to table: it is however evident, that even for cooks by profession, there are certain operations that, to be well under- stood, require to be illustrated: in all cases, it cannot be denied, they are of great use. It is this motive, that has determined me to give so large512 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. a number of drawings, able to shew clearly the elementary working- processes. This book possesses, then, advantages of primary importance; where, side by side with simply described methods, may be found a series of illustrative drawings, which must of necessity greatly facilitate their execution. This work, on its completion, terminates a culinary series, the most comprehensive, that has yet been published.INDEX. A.

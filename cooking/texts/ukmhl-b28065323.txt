INTRODUCTION. MANY excellent and exhaustive works on Cookery no doubt there are, but the Author hopes, agreeing with Owen Meredith in the following lines, that there is room for another. We may live without poetry, music, or art; We may live without conscience, and live without heart ; We may live without friends, we may live without books ; But civilised man cannot live without cooks. He may live without books—what is knowledge but grieving? He may live without hope—what is hope but deceiving ? He may live without love—what is passion but pining ? But where is the man who can live without dining ? “ Lucile,” by Owen Meredith. Many books give only the rudiments of the art, others such proportions that they are quite unsuitable to ordinary people ; the Bills of Fare so large, the Receipts given so intricate that they are difficult to understand, and the various ingredients impossible to procure. They remind one of the story told of the Prince of Soubise in the “ Art of Dining.” “The Prince rejoiced in an excellent chef, as one with such a name should, and his notions of expenditure were also princely. The Prince one day announced that it was his intention to give a supper, BTHE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. o and asked for a ‘ Menu/ The chef presented one with an estimate ; the first article which caught the Prince’s eye was ‘ Fifty Hams.’ f What! ’ said he, ‘ why, Ber- trand, you must be out of your mind ; are you going to feast my whole regiment?’ ‘No, Monseigneur, only one ham will appear on the table; the rest are necessary for my Espagnoles, my blonds, my garnitures.’ ‘ Bertrand, you are plundering me, and this article shall not pass.’ ‘Oh, my lord,’ rejoined the indignant artist, ‘you do not understand our resources ; give the word and those fifty hams, which confound you, I will put them all in a glass bottle no bigger than your thumb.’ ” This is the kind of cookery the Author wishes to avoid, he does not wish fifty hams to be used for one dinner, he does not wish a dish to cost £i when 5s. will do equally well; he does not for one moment pretend that all the Receipts given are original, as he is quite aware that there is nothing new under the sun, but he claims origi- nality in the Bills of Fare, in the proportions, and in many of the Receipts given, and he hopes that the various cooks who read this, may take as much trouble in serving the various dinners with hot dishes, hot covers, and hot plates as he has in preparing this little work. Think, reader, count on your fingers the few houses you know in which a really nice little dinner is served. Think of the greasy gravies called “clear soup,” or the horrible mixtures called “thick soup,” of the sodden, boiled to death, or half-raw “joints of fish,” the flour- and-water sauces, called “melted butter,” and “white sauce,” the tasteless stews, the poor mangled remains of chicken, ducks, pigeons, and game flavoured with highly spiced sauces, walnut catsup, allspice, clove, etc., and called entries. Think of the joint either hung until it might easily walk into the room, making every one wish to walk out, or the hard, either dried-up or raw leg of mutton, which requires a set of steel teeth and an iron jaw to iTi3.stica.tc • Think of the jellies without taste, the milk blanc- manges, the dry puddings which requite at least threeINTRODUCTION. j bumpers of champagne to wash down, and of which only one half-glass well frothed is- generally doled out. Think, reader, think of all these discomforts, and if the Author can remedy them, he will feel amply repaid ; and in case you have the misfortune to have a cook who will not learn, he has thought it better to tell you where you can buy really excellent soups, and gravies, at no greater expense than you can make them at home. The Author proposes to treat on small dinners of taste within the compass of ordinary mortals ; he trusts that the “Bills of Fare” may save trouble to thousands of fair young ladies who have recently entered on the cares of housekeeping, to whom the ordering of dinner is a novelty and a nuisance, and to busy and sporting bachelors whose chief thought is the eating, and not the ordering of the repast. The Author implores his readers who have not a large establishment, if they wish to consult the comfort of them- selves and guests, to limit the number of guests to six or eight. The Bills of Fare are made out with the strictest economy consistent with refined and delicate cookery, and the proportions of the Receipts given are sufficient for six people, so that any cook can curtail the proportions if less is required, and add if more is wanted. A series of “Blunting Menu Cards” by Mr. Edward Kennard, an old resident and forward rider in the Pytchley country, has just been shown to the Author, who can highly recommend them as a decoration for the table. He particularly draws attention to his “ Consomme,” 4 which is really excellent. He knows some prejudice exists against using “ Extract of Meat; ” but he hopes any one who buys this book will try it: they will find that it will greatly reduce, if not entirely dispense with “ the butcher’s greatest friend/’ but the master’s most expensive luxury, the “stockpot.” Ble begs to impress on his readers the economy of fish entries; they are much more easily cooked and served, and half the quantity suffices. Who has not B 2THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 4 had a mass of half-raw cod or salmon doled out, instead of helping oneself to a neat fillet ? He draws attention to a class of entree which is seldom seen on the tables of people of moderate means, and which, if it does appear, resembles dry potted meat instead of a creamy, excellent entree. The entree he alludes to is made of Quenelle Meat. It is the most refined and delicate of all entrees, can be made of veal and almost any game, and can be served poached and fried in various forms. The Author gives the receipt of a Frenchman who was celebrated for the softness and excellence of this class of entree. He impresses on his readers that nothing is in worse taste than too much; he has endeavoured to avoid this in the compilation of his “ Bills of Fare,” and to select the newest and most wholesome Receipts. It was his intention to have had “Bills of Fare” on one page, and directions for cooking the various dishes opposite, so that any master or mistress could have said to the cook, “That Bill of Fare and carried out by those directions I will have to-day,” but he found it quite impossible, as the repetition would have been endless.INTRODUCTION TO BILLS OF FARE. TWELVE FOR EACH MONTH. The Bills of Fare have been arranged with some care, and but few words in explanation will be necessary. Repetitions and omissions doubtless occur, but the Author thinks it better to make frequent use of those things which are in season, and readily obtained at a reasonable price, than to recommend dishes, easily written down, but con- taining articles difficult to procure and expensive. The Author again prefers, in which he hopes that his readers will agree, a good dish twice, or three times a month, to a moderate dish simply for a change. Some may think Game is too frequently entered, but if it is not to be had, one of the Savoury Receipts, or Dressed Vegetables can easily be substituted. Quails or Bordeaux pigeons may be thought expensive, but they are not really so—a Bordeaux pigeon is quite sufficient for two people. Messrs. Bellamy Bros., of Jermyn Street, will supply good fat birds from March to August at is. 6d. and is. 9d. each. Vegetables have not been entered in the “ Bills of Fare,” as the Author considers that the cook will be much better able to select each morning what are ready for use, than he possibly could, climates and seasons making so great a difference. One Entree only has been entered in each “ Bill of Fare.” Unless there is a large party, the Author considers one quite sufficient; if two are required, it is easy to insert a Cutlet or a substantial Entree, when a Quenelle, Rissolette, Friantine, or Croquet is the one selected, and vice versa a Friantine, Quenelle, Rissolette, or Fish Entree, when the Entffie is a substantial one.MENUS POUR JANVIER. 6 FRENCH.

IN preface to this chapter, I think it for the benefit of some of my readers to remark that the Receipts given for Consomme (No. i), Glaze, Aspic Jelly, Espagnole, and Fine Herbs Sauces are the most economical that can be given, but I must at the same time candidly say (and I hope cooks will not be horrified at my say- ing this) that these articles can be bought cheaper, and, in nine cases out of ten, much better than they can be made at home, of Monsieur Emile Beguinot, manufacturer, 40H, Wandsworth Road, who makes sauces in bottles, at one shilling each, sufficient for an entree, which can be obtained at any retail shop. These remarks are not intended to apply to those who are fortunate enough to be blessed with good cooks or where there is a large consumption, but to small houses where the stockpot is not always going and the cook not an artist. A few bottles of Consomme, Aspic Jelly, and Sauces enable one at an hour's notice to give what would take hours to make. CONSOMME OR BROWN STOCK. No. 1. To eight pounds of lean beef or shin of beef (the bone, if the latter, having been broken and all marrow104 THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. extracted), six carrots well washed, scraped and divided lengthways into four parts, two onions quartered, two turnips cut in halves, two small sticks of celery, a dessert-spoonful of sugar and one and a half of salt, add one gallon of water. Put all the ingredients into a stockpot or large stewpan, boil up briskly, and then place on the side of the fire to simmer gently for six hours. Remove the scum as it rises, and after the stock has been on the fire for six hours, strain through a colander into a large basin so as to clear the stock from all meat and vegetables. Then run it again through a tammy cloth to clear it of all small remnants of meat or vegetables which may have been left after the former process, and put it into basins to become cold. When quite cold and required for use, remove the fat, which will have risen to the top, with a wooden spoon; but, as some particles of fat are sure to be left which cannot be taken off with the spoon, wipe the surface of the jelly Avith a clean cloth, which has previously been dipped into warm water and wrung nearly dry. If the stock is not quite clear it should be clarified as follows : Pass two pounds of lean beef, or any other meat of which the stock has been made, through one of Lovelock’s sausage machines, put it in a stewpan, and having warmed the stock, mix it by degrees, a pint at a time, with the meat with a wooden spoon, put it on the fire and stir it until it boils ; then put it on the side of the fire and let it simmer for an hour, add a carrot, onion, and stick of celery all sliced and let it boil, strain through a wet cloth—it should be put in the cloth a pint at a time, and when the last pint is put in, the four corners of the cloth should be pinned together and suspended over a basin until all that is clear has run through. This is the process of clarification for all stocks and soups, as the egg clarification makes them taste thin.STOCKS, ETC. i°5 THE AUTHOR’S CHEAP CONSOMM&. No. 2. To four carrots well scraped, washed, and divided into four parts, two onions quartered, one turnip cut in half, small bit of celery, one dessert-spoonful of sugar, ditto of salt, add two quarts of water. Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, boil up briskly, and put on the side of the fire to simmer until the vegetables are soft; add one dessert-spoonful of Liebig Company’s Extract of Meat, let it simmer for half an hour longer, and strain through a fine colander into a basin. WHITE STOCK. No. 3. The same proportion of everything, excepting the sugar, as in the receipt for Brown Stock (No. 1), only substituting veal or knuckle of veal for beef. The same processes of boiling, straining, clearing of all* fat and grease, and, if necessary, of clarification must be gone through. N.B.—The advantage of putting stock into several basins is that if not required for immediate use, it keeps much better with the fat on. BROWN THICKENING. No. 4. Put half a pound of butter clarified (that is, cleared of all milk) into a stewpan, dissolve it, and stir in with a wooden spoon half a pound of flour until quite smooth, put it on the fire and let it simmer, stirring all the time for an hour or until it becomes a nice brown colour, when put it in a basin for use. It depends greatly on the heat of the fire how long it is before it is a nice brown ; great care must be taken not to let it burn. A dessert-spoonful will thicken a pint of gravy.THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. io6 WHITE THICKENING. No. 5. The same proportions of butter and flour, and the same process as in No. 4, only the fire over which it is prepared must not be so hot, and great care must be taken that the mixture does not acquire any colour. This mixture is used in thickening all white stocks and sauces, and a dessert-spoonful will thicken a pint of either. COMMON GRAVY FOR POULTRY OR GAME. No. 6. Stew the trimmings, that is, the neck, gizzard, pinion bones and feet of whatever poultry or game the gravy is required for in half a pint of water, with a small onion, and two slices of carrot or a small one, a little sugar and salt, for an hour, and add half a tea-spoonful of Liebig Company’s Extract of Meat; thicken a trifle with corn flour, about half a tea-spoonful. GLAZE. No. 7. The reduction of any good stock to the substance of liquid glue, and it is arrived at by boiling until it begins to thicken ; when this commences it should simmer gently until it is thick enough for use, which is when it drops from the spoon like a thick syrup. When required for use put the basin in which it has been placed in hot water to warm. No salt should be used in stock which is to be reduced to glaze, as the reduction is great, and the salt does not reduce with the stock.STOCKS, ETC. 107 ASPIC JELLY. No. 8. Having broken into smallish pieces three pounds of shin of beef (the marrow being extracted), four calves’ feet, four pounds of knuckle of veal, wash them well and put them in a stewpan with three carrots, two onions, a bunch of parsley, and a gallon of water, boil it up and place it on the side of the fire to simmer until reduced to half, skimming the fat off it from time to time. Take it off the fire and let it stand for some minutes, when strain it first through a colander and then through a dinner napkin or rubber, and let it get cold ; when cold remove all fat and grease as in Stock (No. 1), and if necessary clarify by the following process: Whisk the whites of two eggs in a pint of water, warm up the jelly and pour it into it, stirring it well in, allow it to boil a quarter of an hour, and strain it through a jelly-bag. When it is clear, warm it up, and flavour with two or three sprays of green tarragon, and the juice of three or four lemons.CHAPTER II. SAUCES. I WOULD remind my readers that three things are very necessary in the successful making of good sauces. 1st. Great care. 2nd. That all white sauces in which eggs are used must not boil after they are added, and when a thicken- ing is made with flour and butter, the butter must be first melted and the flour mixed in until quite smooth before the water, milk, cream, or stock is added; and as it is of great importance that the milk should be good, and the cream thick, I feel that I am doing my readers a kindness in recommending them, when in London, to obtain those articles from the “ Belgravia Dairy Company ; ” Head Office, 2, Exhibition Road, South Kensington. 3rd. That all clear sauces should be the substance of half-glaze so as not to run all over the dish, and that they should be served in moderation. The proper sub- stance should be arrived at by reducing, as in Glaze (No. 7), but they can also be thickened by mixing in a little Brown & Poison’s corn flour or arrowroot. These should be mixed in a cup with a little stock quite smoothly before putting into the sauce. If arrowroot is used, it must be stirred until it thickens, and not allowed to boil. If corn flour is used, it can be mixed well and then allowed to boil. ALLEMANDE. No. 9. To a pint of White Stock (No. 3) add a pint of boiled milk and an ounce of White Roux, stirring it until itSAUCES. 109 becomes quite smooth, reduce it until thick, add six chopped mushrooms, and a sprig of parsley ; then incorporate four table-spoonfuls of good cream, and let the whole simmer for one minute, stirring all the time, and strain it into a basin for future use. Great care must be taken that it does not boil. This sauce is used for hot and cold entrees, as will be hereafter seen. ANCHO VY. No. 10. To half a pint of Butter Sauce (No. 15) add two dessert- spoonfuls of Burgess & Son’s essence of anchovy, a squeeze of lemon, and if at hand a pinch of Searcy Salt. APPLE. No. 11. Peel and core six small or three large apples, put them in a stewpan with a quarter of a pint of either No. 1 or 2 Stocks, an ounce of sugar, half an ounce of butter, and a small piece of lemon-peel; let the whole simmer until the apples are stewed, then beat through a hair sieve and serve. BECHAMEL. No. 12. Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan, let it melt, add one and a half ounces of flour, and stir it in until smooth, add a sprig or two of parsley, six peppercorns, six mush- rooms, salt to taste, half a pint of White Stock (No. 3), and half a pint of milk, let it boil, stirring until it does, and then put it on one side to simmer for twenty minutes; strain and keep ready for use.THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. I IO BECHAMEL CREAM. No. 13. The same as above, only use half a pint of good cream instead of milk. Great care should be taken in stirring these sauces that the spoon goes well to the bottom and round the sides, so that it does not burn. BREAD SAUCE. No. 14. Stew a small onion and six peppercorns in half a pint of milk for twenty minutes, remove the onion and pepper- corns, and add the crumb of a penny French roll, or two ounces of bread-crumbs, an ounce of butter, and salt to taste ; let it stew for a quarter of an hour, then put it on the fire and stir with a wooden spoon until it boils; add two table-spoonfuls of good cream and serve. If you wish it to be extra good, use cream instead of milk. BUTTER SAUCE OR PLAIN MELTED BUTTER. No. 15. Put two ounces of butter in a saucepan, let it melt, then add one and a half ounces of flour, stir with a wooden spoon until quite smooth, add two-thirds of a pint of cold water and stir the whole over the fire until it thickens, add salt to taste ; an ounce more butter is a great improvement, but not necessary. BUTTER SAUCE. No. 16. To the above Butter Sauce when completed, add a spoonful of cream, the yolk of a beaten egg, and just one squeeze of lemon.SAUCES. in BUTTER, WHIP OF, FOR ASPARAGUS. No. 17.

BUTTER, LOBSTER. No. 20. . f>ound in a mortar two ounces of lobster berries, mixed with two and a half ounces of butter, a tea-spoonful of Burgess & Son’s essence of anchovies, and a little cayenne pepper, rub through a hair sieve. If to be used as a savoury butter, make it into small balls ; if for Cardinal Sauce, let it remain in a basin until required.THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 112 BEARNAISE. No. 21. Put the yolks of four eggs and one ounce of butter in a saucepan and place it in a stewpan of hot water on the fire, or in one of Adams & Son’s milk saucepans ; stir over the fire until the substance begins to thicken, remove from the fire, add one more ounce of butter, the juice of one lemon, and again stir over the fire until it again begins to thicken ; repeat this process until four ounces have been incorporated, add salt to taste, and a table-spoonful of chopped tarragon. This sauce should be the substance of and resemble Mayonnaise Sauce, and requires great care in making or the eggs set and it is spoilt. BROWN SAUCE, CLEAR. No. 22. Reduce some Consomme (No. i) by boiling until it becomes the substance of half-glaze. Consomme (No. 2) may also be thickened with arrowroot or Brown & Poison’s corn flour to the same consistency, but of course it is not so good. CARDINAL SAUCE. No. 23. To half a pint of either White or Cream Bdchamel Sauce, add one ounce of Lobster Butter (No. 20), a tea- spoonful of Burgess & Son’s essence of anchovy and Searcy Salt to taste; make very hot and serve.

FISH. BEFORE commencing the Receipts for various kinds of fish, I wish to remind my readers that the greatest care is necessary in the boiling, frying, and baking of all kinds of fish. I will endeavour to point out so far as it is possible how this may be accomplished, but no hard and fast rule can be laid down either for boiling, frying, or baking, the size and thickness of the fish varying so much in the first, the heat of the lard and oven and size of the fish in the two latter, that a great deal must depend on the attention and observation of the cook. GENERAL RULES FOR BOILING FISH. That four ounces of salt should be as a general rule put into each gallon of water, but eight ounces for salmon and six for shell fish. That all fish should be put into boiling water and well covered with it, and after having boiled up put on the side and simmered only ; the cook can judge when it is done by the meat being soft at the bone. The bones must never be removed from fish when it is to be boiled. When turbot, brill, or sole are filleted, the bones should be left in. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FRYING. That all fish must be well dried before it is egged and crumbed or covered with flour.THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 140 That lard or butter sufficient to cover whatever is to be cooked, should be put in the pan, and that it should be free from all impurities. That the fire should be clear and bright, so that the temperature may be regular; for this reason, gas stoves such as are manufactured by Wm. Sugg & Co., of Charing Cross, are much better than coal, as the heat can be much more easily regulated. That the lard or butter should be 3450 Fahrenheit for ordinary frying, and 400° for whitebait and things which require great heat. That all cooks should buy a pyronometer as sold by Temple & Crook, Motcomb Street, Belgrave Square; if they have not, they can tell the proper heat, as when it ceases to bubble and begins to smoke it is fit for use; or they can tell by throwing in a small piece of bread into the frying-pan now and again, and when it immediately becomes a light brown, it is fit for use. GENERAL RULES FOR BAKING. That the oven should not be too hot, and that all fish should be covered with buttered or oiled paper to prevent it getting dry. FILLET OF BRILL AND DUTCH SAUCE. No. 114.

QUENELLE MEAT, ENTRIES, ETC. QUENELLE MEAT. No. 174. This preparation is made of pounded raw fish or meat, and panada, which is prepared from the essence of the meat used and butter and flour. TO PREPARE THE MEAT. Cut eight ounces of lean fish, meat, or the breasts of poultry or game, and backs of hare and rabbit, pound it in a mortar until quite smooth (for the more it is pounded the better is the quenelle). PANADA. Stew the rough parts of whatever fish, meat, poultry or game the quenelle is to be made of in a quart of water, with a sliced carrot, one onion (if white meat, six mushrooms), a dessert-spoonful of salt, until it is reduced to two-thirds ; strain; put into the stewpan two ounces of butter; melt and stir in with a wooden spoon until it becomes quite smooth two ounces and a half of flour; add a pint of the broth, stir over the fire until it thickens, and then let it simmer for an hour, when it will become a thick smooth sauce ; pour it on a soup plate and let it get quite cool. Add to the pounded meat three ounces of butter, six ounces of panada and an egg beaten up; beat the whole well together, rub through a wire and hair sieve, or one of Kent’s triturating machines, and place it in the cool until it is required for use.I5S THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. The panada not used must also be kept. When the quenelles are required for use, put a saucepan with some boiling water on the fire and place a small piece of the quenelle meat in it for one minute ; if soft like cream and it sets, it is fit for use, if not, add more panada and try it again, and flavour with salt if required, and continue adding the panada until it is quite soft. This quenelle meat can be poached in darioles, rolled up in rissolettes or small rissoles, rolled in bread and butter, covered with a thin pastry, egged and crumbed and fried, directions for which will be given as this chapter proceeds. In making all purees, much trouble will be saved by purchasing one of Kent’s Triturating Strainers. The somewhat dirty, and certainly tedious method of rubbing through a wire, and then a hair sieve, is entirely avoided. This machine can be obtained from 2Js. 6d. and upwards, of Messrs. Kent, 199, High Holborn. As it is of great moment that the powder used in Curries should be good, and that Chutnee Sauces should be of the best quality, I can recommend these articles to be obtained from Stembridge’s Oriental Depot, Leicester Square. ENTREES. In commencing the chapter on Entrees, the Author begs to impress on his readers that all entrees should be selected for their simplicity and cleanliness ; that every meat should be cooked so as to retain its own natural flavour, that there should be no “ highly spiced sauces,” no rich, indigestible, thick brown gravies, no walnut catsup, no strong sauce, not even the proverbial “ bunch of sweet herbs,” of which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the abuse and not the use is alone understood, and which is one of the relics of barbarism handed down to us by our forefathers like gout, and such delicacies. The Author has endeavoured to select entrees which are easily cooked, that are wholesome and delicate, and that the sauces or gravies added may only assist in making more excellent the flavour of the meats used.QUENELLE MEAT, ENTREES, ETC. *59 BEEF ENTREES.

It will only be necessary to say a very few words as a preface to this chapter. The first and most important thing to remember is, that all brown meats should not be over-cooked, but when cut should be pink near the bone ; that all white meat should be thoroughly cooked and quite white at the bone. The second to remember is, as a general rule, that a quarter of an hour is allowed per pound for roasting, and ten minutes for boiling, but that thin pieces do not require so long. The third is, that in roasting meat it should be fre- quently basted, the fat preserved as much as possible, and not be put too close to the fire ; and for heaven's sake never bake it. BEEF. ROAST SIRLOIN. No. 235. Trim about eight pounds of the middle cut of the sirloin, roast for two hours and a half, baste frequently and serve with a pint of weak brown stock or water poured over, and with Horseradish Sauce (No. 37). ROAST FILLET OF BEEF. No. 236.

BRAISED FILLET OF BEEF A LA JARDINIERE. No. 239. Trim the rump fillet and remove with a sharp knife the skin which is on the outside, cut some slices of fat bacon about a quarter of an inch thick and dip it in some finely minced parsley, thyme, and green onions or chives ; sprinkle the fillet with pepper and salt, and tie round it layers of the bacon. Line the braising-pan with slices of fat bacon and put the fillet of beef in it with half a dozen button onions, two large carrots sliced or a dozen young carrots, one bay leaf. To this add half a pint ot Consomme (No. 1), and two glasses of pale sherry. Let it stew for two hours and a half; the pan in which it is braised should not be larger than the meat, which should be basted with its own gravy frequently. Take the meat out of the pan and put it in the oven to set the glaze, being very careful not to let it burn. Put the liquor into a pie-dish to cool, and take off all the fat from it; put the gravy in the braising-pan when cleared of all fat, and reduce it by boiling to two-thirds of its original quantity; when ready to serve, place the fillet in the braising-pan for five minutes to get thoroughlyROASTS, BOILS, AND BROILS. 177 hot and dish up with bunches of green peas, small onion, sprays of cauliflower, young carrots, puree of turnip, all of which should have been stewed in Sweet Consomme (No. 2).

SPICED ROUND OF BEEF. No. 242. Put in a pan, take the bone out of a round of beef and rub well with the following mixture : One and a half ounces of saltpetre, one pound of common salt, half a pound of Mixed Spices (No. 69), three ounces of black pepper, and one pound of common brown sugar, and let it remain three days, then rub it and turn it daily for a month ; wash it, fill up the hole which the removed bone has left, with a piime piece of fat which must have been in the pickle the same time, put it in a large stewpan with two quarts of Consomme (No. 2) and let it simmer until it is cooked, rom six to eight hours according to size ; but if it boils, it will be all in pieces.THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 17S SPICED SILVER SIDE (COLD).

Take it out, draw out the bones, put it between two dishes until cold, let the stock get cold and remove all fat, and put the stock and beef back in the stockpot to get quite hot, cut the carrots into shapes of dice, thicken the gravy with some corn flour, and dish up with the vegetables. BEEF TONGUE, TO CURE AND COOK. No. 247.

LAMB, ROAST, FORE-QUARTER. No. 251. Place the joint some way from the fire and baste frequently; when nearly cooked put it nearer the fire to attain a rich brown, pour half a pint of boiling water, in which put a tea-spoonful of salt, over the joint when dished, and serve with a tureen of Mint Sauce (No. 48).

Hang a loin of four-year old mutton, if you can get it, for a fortnight in the winter, cut the chops in bones, that is, about three-quarters of an inch thick, pepper and salt and broil over a clear fire, turning them frequently until they are cooked ; about eight minutes is quite long enough if you wish the gravy to be in them. Dish each chop on a very hot plate with a very hot cover, and put a small piece of butter on each. MUTTON, BOILED LEG OF. No. 259. Trim a leg of mutton, which should not be hung long, put it into boiling water sufficient to cover it, let it boil up,THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. ] S2 and then place it on the side to simmer until cooked, and put some sliced carrots and turnips quartered in the pot to boil and serve with it when done, which will be in about two hours and a half, but of course the time must depend on the size. Serve some Caper Sauce (No. 24) in a boat, or pour it over the meat. BOILED DECK OF MUTTON. No. 260. The same as above, only trim off some of the fat should there be too much, and let it cook about an hour and a half. MUTTON, NECK OF, BRAISED. No. 261.

Serve it with the vegetables, having put salt to taste. MUTTON, HASHED. No. 262. Cut some thin slices from a roast leg of mutton, put an ounce of butter into a stewpan, two small chopped onions, a little parsley, and a pickled walnut; let these ingredients fry for two minutes, stir in a table-spoonful of flour until quite smooth, when add three-quarters of a pint of Con- somme (No. 2), and let it boil up and simmer gently for fifteen minutes ; strain, add one table-spoonful of mush- room or walnut catsup, a squeeze of lemon, and a tea- spoonful of Searcy Salt ; put the meat in the stewpan, and let it simmer very gently for three-quarters of an hour Serve in an entree dish, with fried croutons of toast.ROASTS, BOILS, AND BROILS, 183 PORK, ROAST LEG OF. No. 263. Score—that is, cut through the skin at equal distances about a quarter of an inch in width—a leg of pork, roast it at some distance from the fire for three hours, and baste it frequently ; about a quarter of an hour before serving put it nearer the fire to brown and get crisp ; pour three- quarters of a pint of brown gravy over it, and serve with Apple Sauce (No. 11) or Brown Chestnut Sauce (No. 27). NECK OF PORK, ROAST. No. 264. The same as above, only roast for an hour and a half instead of three hours. PORK, BOILED LEG OF. No. 265. Put a fresh leg of pork in the pickle jar, in sufficient Pickle (No. 61) to cover it, for at least ten days ; put it into cold water for an hour to soak, put it then into a pot, and put in sufficient cold water to cover it; let it gradually come to the boil, and remove the scum as it rises ; let it simmer only until it is done, which will be in about three hours.

Procure from the butcher a small fillet of veal, say six pounds, stuff it with Stuffing (No. 84), flour it with a dredger, put it some way from the fire, and roast, basting it continually for about two hours. Dish it up, pour half a pint of good Melted Butter Sauce (No. 16) over it, some slices of lemon, and half a pint of good Brown Sauce (No. 22).THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 184 LOIN OF VEAL. No. 268. Roast a small loin of veal in the same way, only protect the fat ovei the kidney, so that it may not all be roasted away ; a small joint will take about two hours. Serve with Melted Butter (No. 16) and brown gravy, and a large slice of toast half an inch thick under it, as the kidney chopped with the fat put on it, and peppered and salted,- is very good. Unless the veal is sent to table very hot I should strongly advise the kidney and fat to be put on the toast at once, sent to the kitchen, and put in the oven for a minute to get very hot, as if cold it is uneatable. VENISON, HAUNCH OF, ROAST. No. 269. Hang a haunch of fat venison as long as it can be hung without being high. Fresh venison is hard, stale venison is simply a disappointment and annoyance to every one in the house ; it reminds one of kennel soup, and a more disgusting aroma than that it is difficult to find. I have been reminded, however, frequently of this poisonous effluvia. To prevent this I would beg my readers to flour their haunches of venison and wipe daily, and dust with pepper, which annoys flies very much.'.As soon as it begins to smell dress it at once. If properly taken care of in a good larder, it should hang a fortnight in the summer and a month in the autumn, unless the weather is very bad. To prepare the venison for roasting, wash it with warm water and dry it with a clean cloth, lay over the haunch a sheet of buttered paper, then a paste of flour and water half an inch thick, cover this with another sheet of stronger paper, tie it securely on with good strong string, and roast it before a good clear fire for about three hours and a half; a quarter of an hour before serving take off the paper and paste, flour it, and put it nearer the fire, to make it a nice brown ; stew some rough parts of the breast to make theROASTS, BOILS, AND BROILS. 185 gravy, brown it with a little colouring, and pour boiling hot into the dish in which the haunch is served, and serve with it some currant jelly warmed up in a sauce-boat. ROAST NECK OF VENISON. No. 270. This is the joint I should strongly advise for all parties under eight. It is quite sufficient, more easily dressed and hung. Roast exactly in the same way as in the directions for the haunch, only roast according to the size, about an hour and three-quarters for a moderate-sized one—the best part of the neck must only be used, and the long bones cut off to within two inches of the meat. Serve the same gravy and sauce as for a haunch. VENISON, HASHED. No. 271. Cut the slices of venison very thin. Having stewed some rough parts of the breast in some Consomme (No. 2), let it get cold, and remove all grease or fat from it; thicken three-quarters of a pint of it with one ounce of butter and a table-spoonful of flour, add a chopped pickled walnut, a small onion chopped, and a table-spoonful of melted red currant jelly; let the whole boil up and simmer for five minutes, strain, add a squeeze of lemon, and put it in a stewpan with the slices of venison, and let them stew in it for half an hour.CHAPTER VII. GAME AND POULTRY ROASTING. A GOLDEN rule to remember in the roasting of all poultry and game is that it should be juicy and succulent. This can be assured by rubbing the bird all over with lard or butter, and by then covering it with thin slices of fat bacon ; it may add a trifle to the expense, but it certainly adds greatly to the excellence, it ensures it being well basted, and it comes to the table with a moist, luscious appearance, instead of looking like a piece of an old mummy. In trimming all poultry and game the legs are greatly improved by the bone being broken just above the foot and the sinews of the leg pulled out. The pinion bones should be cut off, and pray omit the barbarous custom of ornamenting birds with feathers—one begins to think the dinner is given by an Ojibbeway Indian: a few glass beads would make the decoration perfect. I am quite aware that in the close ranges now so much in use, there is some difficulty in roasting before the fire, and although a large joint may give great trouble, all game and poultry can easily be done, either in a Dutch oven, or in one of Brown & Green's double-pan roasting screens. I have one of the most difficult ranges to manage, but I never dream of allowing any meat or game or poultry to be baked. In roasting in a Dutch oven care should be taken not to put it too close to the fire as, if so, the outside dries up before the part next the bone is cooked.187 GAME AND POULTRY ROASTING.

Three or four remarks in the dressing of vegetables are necessary :—■ 1st.—Especially in a small house, prevent the horrible smell which arises from boiling greens, fumigating and stinking out your guests, by tying a piece of bread- crust in a muslin bag and keeping it in the pot during the process of boiling. 2nd.—Remember that all vegetables, excepting globe artichokes, are better dressed the day they are cut or picked. 3rd.—That all vegetables, excepting split peas, Jerusa- lem artichokes, and potatoes, are put into boiling water. 4th.—That all vegetables should be well boiled, but not too quickly; and that two ounces of salt should be put in each gallon of water, and if the water is hard, a little soda.

BEFORE commencing making pastry it is absolutely necessary : ist.—That everything therewith connected should be very clean. 2nd.—That the sooner it is put in the oven after making the better it is. 3rd.—That the less fingered the better it is; and last, but not least, that the oven, although sufficiently heated to raise the paste quickly, should not be hot enough to brown it before it is cooked. In pudding-batter, the only remark I think it necessary to make is to be sure that the suet and eggs are fresh, that the puddings should be put into plenty of water to boil, and that they should be served as soon as possible after being taken out of the pot.

I do not think you ever get ice better than at Gunter’s shop, where it is taken out of the freezing-pot and put into no shapes. It must be somewhat over-frozen to retain the shape, so unless you have a very good cook, I should strongly advise that all ices should be taken out of the freezing-pot just before they are sent to table and put into a glass dish in spoonfuls as they are taken out. Ice should be quite smooth, and soft enough to cut with a spoon. APRICOT CREAM ICE. No. 426.

SAVOURIES. SAVOURIES are always acceptable and useful, especially in the spring and summer months, when there is no game, and quails and Bordeaux pigeons somewhat expensive, and in the country not always to be obtained. For this reason I have endeavoured to give a strong list of dishes which I trust may prove useful and really good. Many of the Vegetable Savouries I have put amongst the Vegetables, so I must ask my readers to refer to Chapter VIII. for any they cannot find in this chapter. In servingFish Savouries avoid their being dry,especially those in which shrimps and Parmesan cheese are used ; and in savouries which are masked with Parmesan, pray be careful not to serve them as if they were baits for mouse- traps. They should be coloured, but moist; if dry, they burn and are spoilt. ANCHOVY, ECLAIR OF—ECLAIR HANCHOIS. No. 492.

First, most strongly let me beg of you not to stint your guests; you may just as well stint them of “bread or potatoes ” as of whatever wine you give. Different people have different tastes, and are differently constituted—some like a bottle, some a pint, some a glass, and as this is the case, always has been, and I suppose always will be, do not, if you wish to be really hospitable, mete out your allowance by what you drink yourself, or think sufficient. If you cannot afford, or have not the heart to give good wine, give good beer, or good cider, the latter of which can be got at Messrs. Bentall & Lloyd’s, Totnes. Secondly.—Do not mix your wines at dinner; whatever you begin with, drink through dinner, and consider your poor inside a little. I have seen, seldom, I am glad to say, Chablis with oysters, Punch with soup, Hock with fish, Champagne with joint, Chateau Yquem with the sweets, and to settle these comfortably (!) a glass of Port wine with the cheese. I was told some years ago that a “ Cornet’s ” breakfast at a West-End hotel consisted of two raw eggs » beaten up in a wine-glass of Worcestershire sauce and a tea-spoonful of Cayenne pepper ! I should imagine that the said Cornet indulged in such a conglomeration as the above. No. Take my advice, stick to one wine at dinner, and one small glass of very old Cognac as a chasse, if a chasse you must have ; and if the Claret is “ really good,” a glass, sTHE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 258 or two, or three, or even a bottle now and then won’t hurt you, and you will not require the said Cornet's breakfast. Avoid as poison all brandies and whiskies and sodas after having drank sufficient wine. These are what ruin the health of and kill thousands every year. Thirdly.—Get the best wine you can, and keep it; this applies to all wines if good and sound when laid down. Deal with one wine merchant, and so make it worth his while to supply you well, and if you have a good cellar and can afford to buy the best, lay down in a good year sufficient to last you for six or seven years ; there is seldom a good vintage more frequently. Many people think Champagne does not improve by keeping. No wine improves more. This was impressed on my memory some years ago by the remarks of an old friend of mine noted for his wine, to a young guest who condescended to approve of the Champagne, and say he had never tasted any like it. “ It ought to be good, I have had it twenty years," and on the guest saying he did not know Champagne improved by keeping, received the rejoinder, “You have a good deal to learn." Fourthly.—Do not decant more wine than you think will be consumed. No wine, except Sherry, is drinkable the second day, and Claret is simply ink. Fifthly.—Do not leave wine in cases. Unpack it as soon as it arrives and put it in bins, so that you can see if it leaks. This applies more especially to Cham- pagne, and it is the very wine which some people keep in cases. It is the greatest error in judgment, as if it leaks it should be dipped in wax at once. I am indebted to Messrs. Maxwell & Keys, of James Street, Haymarket, for this information. ON DECANTING. All old wine should be decanted. Having laid down the best wines, the greatest care should be taken to pro- duce them at the table at a proper temperature and259 WINES AND THEIR SERVICE. properly decanted, and I would most strongly advise every one who has really good old wine to obtain wine baskets, and a “ decanting machine with screw movement on wood block ” and a lever corkscrew from Farrow & Jackson in the Haymarket, and having obtained them proceed as follows : Put as many bottles as are likely to be consumed in the decanting baskets, taking great care that the side on which they lay in the bin is down- wards. Place the bottle which is to be decanted very steadily into the decanting machine, draw the cork without the slightest jerk or movement, and with a damp cloth wipe the mouth of the bottle. Place a light either under or by the side of the bottie so that you can see the moment the slightest cloud appears ; screw the lever very gradually until three parts of the bottle is decanted, when remove the decanter, and decant the remainder into wine-glasses; so long as no cloud appears and the wine is quite fine, add the wine-glasses to the bottle, the moment the cloud appears add no more—half a glass will spoil the whole bottle. How often we hear, “ This is an excellent bottle,” and the next not quite the same, especially in Claret; the real truth being that the ignorant or the careless servant, or still more ignorant or obstinate host, has jumbled the whole thing up, and spoilt in five minutes wine which has been taken the greatest care of for twenty years. No ; unless you have a careful and trustworthy servant, decant your own wine, and by the above method, and you will find that your bottles will be, with very few exceptions, all alike. I remember hearing a story of a noble lord, well known for his unadorned Saxon, complaining to his old house steward that he always sent up the Claret thick. I he steward replied that he always sent up the whole bottle, as if he had not, he thought his lordship would complain. The reply he received was, “ In future, then, don't send up the whole bottle, you fool! ” The order was strictly obeyed, and only three parts of a bottle in future appeared, but his friends always said that the “ fool,” as he was so politely called, kept back the two jirst and not the two last glasses for his own consumption.26o THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. ON PRODUCING VARIOUS WINES TO THE TABLE. BURGUNDY. Decant as in Rules for Decanting-, and in the winter put it on the chimney-piece in the dining-room six hours before dinner; in the summer in the room. Burgundy should not be warmed as much as Claret. Notch the cork aP round and put in the decanter, so that it shall admit air, but not enough to make it flat. Burgundy is a wine far too seldom seen on English tables, especially as a dinner wine ; it has more flavour, more nourishment, and is cheaper than the corresponding vintages of Claret. For instance, Pommard, to lay down, is 50.y. a dozen, and this wine is about the “ Leoville” of Clarets ; Chambertin, the Lafitte of Burgundy, can be bought at the same reduction in price. If the Claret flavour is preferred, Romanee Conti and Clos Vougeot more resemble this wine, but if you drink “ Burgundy ” drink “ Burgundy ” say I, and I recommend Pommard and Chambertin. CHAMPAGNE. Of all wines, Champagne is the easiest to produce in a proper condition to the table, although opinions may differ as to the extent it should be iced. All old Champagne if iced, should be laid on the ice with the greatest care so as not to shake the bottle, and be decanted as in the directions for decanting wine. In the opinion of some connoisseurs, very old and fine Champagne should not be iced at all in the winter, and only slightly in the summer, but the general taste is, no doubt, that all Champagne should be well iced; on the other hand the greatest number of Champagne drinkers do not drink old and fine Champagne. As a general rule, then, I will put it thus : Decant and ice moderately all Champagnes over ten years in bottle, as there is frequently a strong deposit in old Champagnes, especially in “Still.” Ice moderately all good Champagne under ten years in bottle,261 WINES AND THEIR SERVICE. and although it is not necessary to decant it, I personally think it is improved thereby ; but I should certainly say if the Champagne is moderate, do not decant it, and ice it as much as possible, the fizz and the ice may disguise the taste—I won’t call it flavour. CLARET. Clarets are warmed in different ways by different people. I have seen it plunged into hot water with tiie cork in ; I have seen it arranged by dozens in a bachelor’s room so as to be ready warmed in case of sudden thirst ; and this reminds me of a story poor Whyte Melville used to tell, that on calling one day on his way home from hunting on a gallant officer hunting with the Pytchley, he saw a dozen of Claret warming before the fire, when he remarked, “Got a dinner party?” “Oh, no, only the Colonel and myself.” Others put it before the fire and then into a cold decanter, and the sudden change from hot to cold chills and quite spoils the wine. I know no wine so difficult to produce at a right temperature, and I am quite convinced that the only way to produce all bottles alike is to put the decanters and claret in a temperature of 60 degrees for ten hours before dinner and decant each bottle when it is wanted, observing most carefully the rules laid down for decanting. I have heard that when old Claret has been moved it does not recover itself until after the second flowering of the grape ; that is, if it is moved in August it takes two years to recover, and I really think this is true. I remember perfectly a friend of mine buying some Claret in Paris, and he thought he had been swindled as it tasted so different after having rested six months ; but he kept some for two years, and it quite regained its excellence. 1 also remember having heard that a certain connoisseur had a closet made, warmed to a temperature of 60 degrees, on purpose for his Claret, and each decanter was encased in flannel so as to retain the heat, and he had a silver thermometer to try each262 THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. bottle. This may seem ridiculous, but I really think if you take the trouble to lay down wine for twenty years, no trouble can be too great to produce it in its best state at the table. HOCK. Decant most carefully all fine old Hock an hour before it is required ; warming does not improve it; in fact, when good, it is meat and drink. If any one drinks “ Steinberg Cabinet,” of a good vintage, once, it is a wine never for- gotten, but it is very expensive and dificidt to get. Light Hock, however, such as Nierstein, is a very nice clean wine for dinner, and a glass or two of Geisenheim after dinner won’t hurt you in the summer. PORT. Decant most carefully. This wine requires no heat if the cellar is warm. I think it should be decanted just before dinner. I never can tell why this excellent wine is gone out of fashion. No black wine has such flavour, and, if good, it is quite as wholesome as Claret. Our forefathers lived as long, drank more, and of this very wine, port; and nowadays, you see a poor weakly-looking “ masher ” say he “cannot drink port,” when probably a bottle of old’58 a day, and fevuer il cigarettes,” would make a man of him. SHERRY.

BROWN & POISON’S CORN FLOUR FOR THE NURSERY. In ordinary cases the only suitable food for young infants is milk. So soon, however, as some solid addition to the liquid food becomes desirable, there is nothing better for the purpose than BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR. Its principal function is to supply heat. It also contributes to the formation of fat, so essential to life at all stages, but especially to the earlier. BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR FOR THE FAMILY TABLE. In the hands of an accomplished cook there is no known limit to the variety of delicate and palatable dishes which may be produced from BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR. It is equally susceptible of plain and simple treatment for ordinary domestic purposes, and one of its chief recommendations is the facility with which it may be prepared. Boiled with milk, and with or without the addition of sugar and flavouring, it may be ready for the table within fifteen minutes; or poured into a mould and cooled, it becomes in the course of an hour a Blanc-mange, which, served with fresh or preserved fruit, will be acceptable at any meal. Add sultanas, raisins, marmalade, or jam of any kind, and in about the same time it is made into an excellent Baked Pudding. To which may be added : Take care to boil with milk, when so required, for not less than eight minutes. BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR FOR THE SICK ROOM. The properties of BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR are identical with those of arrowroot, and it is in every respect equal to the costliest qualities of that article. The uses of arrowroot in the sick room are not only matter of tradition, but of every-day experience, and there can be but few persons who are not acquainted with its uses as an important ally to medical treatment. BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR claims to serve the same purposes, with at least equal acceptance and at considerably less cost, and therefore offers the facility of freer use to a larger public. ■ It has received from medical and scientific authorities the highest testimonials to its purity and serviceableness; it is largely used in Hydropathic and other Institutions throughout the Kingdom, and its export to all foreign parts has long given it a world- wide reputation. NOTE.—Purchasers of Corn Flour should insist on being supplied with BROWN & POLSON’S. It is distinguished for uniformly superior quality.2 THE PYTCHLEY BOOK OF REFINED COOKERY.

THE ORIGINAL AND ONLY GENUINE. CHLORODYNE is admitted by the profession to be the most wonderful and valuable remedy ever discovered. CHLORODYNE is the best remedy known for Coughs, Consumption, Bronchitis, Asthma. CHLORODYNE acts like a charm in Diarrhoea, and is the only specific in Cholera and Dysentery. CHLORODYNE effectually cuts short all attacks of Epilepsy, Hysteria, Palpitation, and Spasms. CHLORODYNE is the only palliative in Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Gout, Cancer, Tooth- ache, Meningitis, &c. From W. Vesalius Pettigrew, M.D. “ I have no hesitation in stating that I have never met with any medicine so efficacious as an Anti-Spasmodic and Sedative. I have used it in Consumption, Asthma, Diarrhoea, and other diseases, and am perfectly satisfied with the results.” CAUTION—BEWARE OF PIRACY AND IMITATIONS. Caution.—“Vice-Chancellor Sir W. Page Wood stated that Dr. J. Collis Browne was undoubtedly the inventor of Chlorodyne, that the story of the defendant, Freeman, was deliberately untrue, which he regretted to say had been sworn to."—See Times, July 13, 1864. Sold in bottles at is. i%d., 2s. 9d., and 4s. 6d. each. None is genuine without the words, “Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne,” on the Government Stamp.

BREAKFAST AND SAVOURY DISHES. By R. 0. C., compiler of the “ Official Handbook for the National Training School for Cookery.” Crown 8vo. From “THE TIMES,” August 21st. “The success which has attended the publication of the Official Handbook of the National Training School for Cookery—a collection of recipes, indeed, rather than a handbook in the accented sense of the title—has encouraged the compiler, R. O. C., to issue a shilling pamphlet entitled ‘Breakfast and Savoury Dishes,' for the preparation of which forty-three recipes have been drawn up with careful detail. Loose phraseology of the old cookery books, such as take a ‘ little’ or a ‘pinch ’ or a ‘spoonful,’and so forth, is discarded, and precise terms and quantities are used instead. At the head of each recipe the quantity of ingredients required for carrying out the recipe, and the cost thereof, are given. Of the forty-three recipes three are allotted to the preparation of potables in ordinary use at the British breakfast table. A warning note is sounded against allowing tea to stand longer than five minutes, after which time the decoction becomes charged with an unwholesome amount of tannin. Deliberate operations are insisted upon for the making of good coffee, and the use and re-use of cocoa nibs are expounded. Then follow ten methods of making breads, scones, galettes, muffins, crumpets, oat cakes, short bread, milk rolls, and Yorkshire tea cake?. Somersetshire girdle (or gridiron) cake might very well have been added to this list. A daintier and not more costly way of cooking ceufs au leurre noir is by treating each egg separately, and serving it in a little pipkin or cocote; and a few more than three recipes for various savoury omelettes might have been given in place of those for potted meats, which do not recommend themselves to small households while endless tins of potted meats are procurable at any grocer’s. Then useful recipes for cooking fish—including a succulent arrangement of lobster au gratin (at a cost of 3s. 9d.)—follow next; and the series concludes with recipes for grilled and devilled chicken or turkey, and for pigeon pie, in the completion of which the necessity of following the sound practice of pouring flavoursome gravy through the hole in the crust of the baked pie is enforced. “ This little book, as will be seen, is intended for the ready and managing housekeeper. But a Vatel may not find many of its suggestions beneath his notice.” FOURTEENTH THOUSAND.

Compiled by R. O. C. Large Crown 8vo, 8s. “Asa Christmas present a hook upon cookery obviously has many and appropriaterecommen- dations. In the 1 Official Handbook ’ there are, for instance, some very lucid and explicit directions for the making of a plum-pudding, merely to read over the ingredients for which has a tendency to make the mouth water. The cost of this article of luxury is, however, something over 4s.—a large sum for poor people to disburse even on unusual occasions of festivity. A book such as this will, it is probable, be appreciated mostly by those to whom economy in the kitchen is a matter of serious consideration. Turning, therefore, to another page, it is gratifying to find that it is possible to provide, at the cost only of nd., not quite so rare a dainty, perhaps, but a good solid one, three- quarters of a pound in weight. Many other dishes, too, are here set forth, which read as though they should taste well, and the preparation of which need not alarm the thriftiest, Ihe good point about the book is that it presupposes complete ignorance on the part of the pupil; nothing is left to haphazard : every quantity is given in its exact and due proportion, and the price of each ingredient carefully set down. All these lessons, moreover, have been practically tested in the Nationa Training School and may therefore be accepted in good faith. It is not, however, to he supposed tha any cunning recipes of rare and costly dishes are to be found in this book ; the first principles o good cookery is the lesson it professes to teach, and certainly the method of tuition is direct and easy to follow.*'—The Times.13 THE PYTCHLEY BOOK OF REFINED COOKERY.

Potatoes cooked in this way are cer- tainly more pleasant to the taste ; and, what is vastly more important, they are more digestible than when simply boiled.”— Health (Edited by Dr. Andrew Wilson). “ ‘ All sorts and conditions ’ of Potatoes have been cooked in it with invariable satisfactory results.”—The Caterer. “ An invention which most assuredly meets, and that perfectly, an universal and daily want.”— Building World. 14 By this invention there is an absolute certainty of their being well and thoroughly cooked, and being dished up in a proper condition. I have tested the Steamer myself, and am quite satisfied with the result of its action on both New and Old Potatoes.”—Bazaar, Exchange, and Mart. “ These and other obstacles have been successfully overcome by the new Potato Steamer repre- sented in our woodcut.”—Cassell’s Family Magazine. “ It certainly does its work admirably, and appears to supply a want long felt by cooks and house- keepers.”—Editor, Ladds Pictorial. TESTIMONIALS. Messrs. BERTRAM & ROBERTS write : “Gentlemen,—Bower's Potato Steamer (20 lbs.) I had of you answers admirably, and I can strongly recommend it. “W. H. OLIVER, ‘Chef.’" The following unsolicited Testimonial is from the Editor of one of the leading Illustrated London Papers. “ Gentlemen,—A few weeks ago you kindly sent me one of your patent Potato Steamers which I acknowledged before I had had time to test its merits ; it really is invaluable. It has fallen to my lot to have all sorts and kinds of potatoes and divers cooks of late, but they simply cannot help cooking the potatoes properly. I have never had them served up so uniformly well in my life, and hope that in a short time no family or restaurant may be without your Steamers. “Believe me to be, etc.’’ We are authorised by the NATIONAL SCHOOL OP COOKERY, SOUTH KEN- SINGTON, to state that Bower’s Potato Steamer has been thoroughly tested with the result that it fully accomplishes what is claimed for it, viz.—That any sort of potato can be cooked to perfection in it by even an unqualified person.” SIZES-31bs. 5/-; 41bs. 6/-; 61bs. 7/6; lOlbs. 15/-; 151bs. 18/6; 201bs. 23/6 To be obtained of any Ironmonger in town or country at the above-mentioned prices, and wholesale of the sole Manufacturers, GROOM & CO., Liquorpond Street, London, E.C.H THE PYTCHLEY BOOK OF REFINED COOKERY.

TO MAKE BREAD .—To every pound of flour add a large heaped-up teaspoonful of Borw,ick’s Gold Medal Baking Powder with a little salt, and thoroughly mix while in a dry state, then pour on gradually about half-a-pint of cold water, or milk and water, mixing quickly but thoroughly into a dough of the usual consistence, taking care not to knead it more than is necessary to mix it perfectly ; make it into small loaves, which must be immediately put into a quick oven. PUFF PASTE .—Mix one pound of flour with a teaspoonful of Borwick’s Gold Medal Baking Powder, then cut half-a-pound of butter into slices, roll it in thin sheets on some of your flour, wet up the rest with about a quarter of a pint of water, see that it is about as stiff as your butter, roll it to a thin sheet, cover it with your sheets of butter, double it in a three double ; do the same five times. It is then fit for use, or it may stand an hour covered over to keep the air from it. TO MAKE A RICH PLUM CAKE.—Take half-a-pound of butter and half-a-pound of white sifted sugar, beat these with the hand well together to a cream, add four eggs, one at a time, and well beat each one with the butter and sugar, lightly mix in one pound of flour previously mixed with one teaspoonful of Borwick's Gold Medal Baking Powder, then lightly mix with the whole half-a-pound of sultanas, bake at once, thoroughly, in a quick oven. TO MAKE A GOOD PLAIN CAKE .—Mix well together one pound of flour, two teaspoonfuls of Borwick's Gold Medal Baking Powder, a little salt and spice, and a quarter-of-a-pound of sugar, rub in a quarter-of-a-pound of butter, add six ounces of sultanas, two ounces of currants, and one ounce of candied peel ; moisten the whole with two eggs and half-a-teacupful of milk previously beaten together ; bake in a quick oven very thoroughly. SCOTCH SCONES. — Take one pound of flour, add a full teaspoonful of Borwick’s Gold Medal Baking Powder and a little salt, mix thoroughly wrhile dry, rub in two ounces, of butter, beat up one egg well in a quarter-of-a-pint of milk or water, then thoroughly and quickly mix together ; bake immediately on a girdle or in a quick oven. This will make eight delicious scones. TEA CAKES- Use the recipe as for scones, but add a few currants, sultanas, or caraways if preferred. SHORT BREAD .—Mix well together one pound and a quarter of flour, a large teaspoonful of Borwick's Gold Medal Baking Powder, and half-a-pound of white sifted sugar, rub in half-a-pound of butter, mix the whole with three eggs, previously well beaten, and a little essence of lemon.

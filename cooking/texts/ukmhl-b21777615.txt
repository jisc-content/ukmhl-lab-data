INCLUDING HE CALENDAR AND ' KINDRED MATTER, ' UNIVERSAL HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY, ARMY AND NAVY, SCIENCE, LITERATURE, FINE ARTS, ARCHITECTURE, COMMERCE, AGRICULTURE, MEDICAL, SPORTS AND PASTIMES, THE HOUSEHOLD, PORT SUNLIGHT, ETC. ALSO STORY BY CONAN DOYLE. WITH PORTRAITS AND NUMEROUS ILLUSTRATIONS. PORT SUNLIGHT: LEVER BROTHERS, Limited.PEEFACB The Sunlight Year Book enters upon its fourth year of publication with this issue. The aim of the publishers in every past succeeding year has been that the issue for each coming year should excel its predecessor in its treasures of informa- tion on the most interesting subjects of every-day life for everybody. Stimulated by many kind and complimentary letters the 1897 issue received, the publishers have spared neither time nor expense in the writing and compiling of the 189S edition in order that the information printed within its page* will be as practicable and useful as possible. New subject,; have been introduced, including Universal History, Geography, Architecture, and Commerce, whilst Literature, Fine Arts, Science, Agriculture, Sports, Pastimes, Medicine, and matters pertaining to the Household are dealt with in a concise, clear, and crisp manner. Naturally, some subjects in a Tear Booh of this description interest one sex more than another ; but all will, we think, read with interest and pleasure the romance by Conan Doyle, the well-known author and novelist, which has been specially written for the proprietors. "We trust that our labour will prove of pleasure and ser- vice to all, and make the Sunlight Year Book for 1898 welcomed and valued in every household." SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK.

These are sold at fancy prices and are consequently out of reach of the great ma jority of soap users, who have hitherto had to content themselves with more or less adulterated soaps. This need no longer be the case. The SUNLIGHT SOAP is the most successful attempt which has been made to supply an absolutely pure soap which is a splendid detergent, and yet can be manufactured to sell at a price which brings it within the reach of all. In the first place it will be well to determine the qualities which ate essential for a good soap. The most obvious necessity is that it should be a powerful detergent, for a soap that will not cleanse is a contradiction in terms. The second essential for a good soap is that, without losing its detergent qualities, it shall be wholly innocuous. Thirdly, it is necessary that the ideal soap should wash and lather freely in the hardest spring water as well as in the softest rain water. Otherwise, at many seasons, and in many places, it would be absolutely useless. The fourth and last essential is, that the soap should remove dirt -without the necessity for much rubbing. If this is not the case, then no matter how innocuous the ingredients of the soap may be in themselves, the constant rubbing entailed by the want of SUNLIGHT SOAP qualities will cause the clothes to wear out ten times as fast as they should do. To sum up, then, the ideal soap should be a powerful deter- gent, it should be absolutely innocuous to the most tenr?er"$kin, the lightest washable fabric, or the most delicate colour; it should wash equally well in every sort of water, and it should wash with little labour. The qualities required in an ideal soap are fortunately to be found in a real soap, and that is the SUN= LIGHT SOAP. This is a fancy name adopted by the manu- facturers to designate this special soap, and we think it is a particularly happy one, for by the use of this soap half tho labour and fatigue entailed by the old-fashioned soaps are avoided, and washing is rendered no longer a pain, but a pleasure. wherever SUNLIGHT SOAP is found."The SCIENCE of CLEANING. MEDICAL OPINION. From SIR CHARLES A. CAMERON, M.D., Ex-President of the Royal College of Surgeons, Vice-President of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain, dte., Sc., <£c., Laboratory, Eoyal College of Surgeons, Stephen's Green, W., Dublin, February 15th, 1888. I have carefully analysed specimens of the SUN- LIGHT SOAP submitted to me for that purpose by Messrs. Lever Bros., Ltd., and the following are the results at which I have arrived : The points in the composition of this Soap that are the most valuable are its freedom from free alkali, the large percentage of fatty acids which it contains, and the PURITY of the materials employed in its preparation. I employ the Soap my- self, and from my actual experience of it can strongly recommend it. (Signed) CHARLES A. CAMERON. Dr. 0. M. Campbell, a skin doctor of large experience, writing from 37, Queen Ann Street, Cavendish Square, London, says he has tested it repeatedly with a patient Buffering from acute eczema, " The application excited no irritation whatever, although the patient's skin is of the most delicate type."

The institution of the Ministry or Cabinet which forms, so to speak, the Governing Board of the United Kingdom, dates from a few years after the Eevolution of 1688. " The first Ministry," says Macaulay," was the work, partly of mere chance, and partly of wisdom—that. lower wisdom which meets daily exigencies by daily expedients. Neither William nor the most en- lightened of his advisers §% fully understood the nature and importance of that noiseless revolution—for it was no less—which began about the close of 1693; " and again Macaulay writes: " The era of Ministers may most properly be reckoned from the day of the meeting of the Parliament after the general election of IG93." The control of a leader or head, who is now called the Premier, may be said to have commenced in Queen Anne's reign. Yet, we may add, for many years the Cabinet was without an absolutely acknowledged head, and without the full powers which it now possesses. Georgelll. indeed endeavoured to reduce Ministers to dependency on himself. At present when a Government resigns office, the Sovereign sends for the leader of one of the principal Pailia- mentary parties, who then becomes Prime, or, First Minister, and who forms another Government.

The Congregationalists claim that their principles are Apostolic, i.e., that the congre- gations collected by the Apostles were Churches, and that each Church should be free from the control of the State or of Presbyteries. Hence arises the name Independent. John Huss, the great Eeformer, held similar views {about 1413) as, for instance, his remark that the Church is divided into many parts, all of which together constitute the entire Church. Zwingli, the great Swiss Eeformer, also held a similar doc- trine. But the English Congregationalists, as we now know them, may be said to have taken their rise after the Eefor- mation, and first appeared in English History during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The oldest Congregational Church is at Horningsham, "Wilts., claiming to have been founded in 15QQ, while another Congregational Church existed at Plumbers' Hall in 15Q7. There are now, in round numbers, about 4,820 Congregational churches and branch churches in the British Isles, not including Mission Stations in Scotland, with 12 colleges, the prin- cipal being Mansfield, at Oxford. The churches unite together voluntarily to form county unions, and also a" SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. 122 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Edinburgh, 1890. Union for England and Wales (Secretary, Eev. W. J. Woods, B.A., Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, London, E.O.), one for Scotland, one for Ireland, and have a great number of religious and philanthropic organizations. The London Mis- sionary Society, though undenominational in character, is very largely supported by Congregationalists. t The Baptists. ! Like their Congregational brethren, the Baptists hold also the doctrine that every Church should be free from external control in ecclesiastical affairs. But they hold that baptism should be administered only on profession of faith, and that the mode should be by imme»sion and not by sprinkling or pouring. The Baptists claim that one of their churches existed in England'in 1417, and several claim to have been founded before Elizabeth's reign. Since then they have grown amazingly, and though there are some sub- divisions, the great bulk of their churches unite m County and a National Union, (Secretary, Eev. Dr. S. H. Booth, Mission House, Eurnival Street, London). Their Foreign Missionary Society was founded in 1792. The num- ber of their chapels in Great Britain and Ireland is over 3,820, with nearly 2,000 pastors. The Presbyterians. Presbyterianism, it is said, was known in the early Church, and in Scotland, even before a bishop was appointed. But Calvin and John Knox practically gave Presbytenanism the shape svhich it has since exhibited, though since modified. A Presbytery is composed of the ministers and some ot the elders of a district who have superintendence of the congre- gations ; and to the Presbytery appeals may be made. There are also Synods and Assemblies. Many of the Puritans not being Separatists, were Presbyterian: in 1572 a Presbyterian Church had boldly been formed at Wandsworth. After the passing of the Toleration Act in 1689, the organization of the Eno-lish Presbyterians appears to have declined ; some joined ^Independents, and some, perhaps most, But about 1843, the date of the formation of the Free Chuuh in Scotland, signs of renewed life stirred many Pr^byterians £ England an! in 1876 two English Synods joined and took thenime_ohhe^PRINCIPAL'NONCONFORMIST CHURCHES. 123 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Jamaica, 1891.

The Established Church of Scotland is Presbyterian, and the Crown of the United Kingdom appoints a Lord High Commissioner to be present at the Annual Assembly, Ine Church of Scotland has sixteen Synods, and, eighty-four Presbyteries, and about 1,733 ministers with 1,733 parishes. The Establishment of Presbyterianism m Scotland took place at the Eeformation, was set aside in 1662, but after the Eevolution of 1688 it obtained again its legal Establishment, and has ever since preserved it. The Presbyterian Ebee Church of Scotland was formed in 1843 by seceders, the event being known as "The Dis- ruption." The real gist of the dispute was the important principle of the right of the Church to independent action separate from the State, and the right of the congregations to choose their own ministers. The Free Church was soon organised and raised £367,000 in its first year. Now it has some sixteen Synods, seventy-five Presby- teries, nearly 1,100 congregations, and over 1,100 ministers.

NAPOLEON. DUKE OF WELLINGTON.140 "SUNLIGHT?1 YEAR-BOOK. THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION. INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND. The Stone Age.—Mankind used stone for making weapons and tools. This era of human existence has varied with different peoples, the South Sea Islanders, for instance, remaining within that era until the nineteenth century. European nations, however, passed through a Stone age centuries before Christ was born. The Bronze Age.—It is supposed that, from the use of etone^ mankind went on to the use of bronze. Brass in the Bible would probably be more correctly rendered bronze, this metal being a mixture of tin and copper, though sometimes other metals; zinc, silver, and lead are found in ancient bronze. The Iron Age.—From the use of bronze certain peoples passed on to the use of iron, and the poems of Homer show a nation passing from one to the other. In Genesis iv. 22 it is stated that iron was worked by Tubal Cain. The Alphabet.—The accuracy of the statement that the Phoenicians invented their alphabet is doubted. It is probable that it was derived from Egyptian picture-writing. But may not the Phoenicians have invented a picture-writing themselves? Nevertheless, the fifty modern alphabets are believed to be developments from the Phoenician. The alpha- bet is held to be the oldest trace of civilization. Buildings.—The earliest building materials were most probably elay and wood. Before building, mankind pro- bably lived in caves. From using clay man got on, most likely, to using slabs of sun-dried clay, or drying and burn- ing the clay slabs in a fire, and the use of bricks began, They were used in very early days of civilization. Glass, according to tradition, was discovered by the Phoenicians. One day some merchants placed cooking pots on lumps of soda on a sandy spot and kindled a fire under the pots. The soda and sand were fused by the heat and pro- duced a glass. Its manufacture is shown on Egyptian sepul- chres dating back some 2,500 years before Christ, and it is mentioned even earlier. Early Navigation.—The Phoenicians and Egyptians were SUNLIGHT SOAP is made atTHE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION. 141 the largest soap works in the world. probably among the earliest navigators. Mankind probably first floated on logs ; then logs were most likely bound together to form a raft; next a log would be hollowed out; in some cases wickerwork coracles covered with skins were made. Further ships were built up from rafts by adding ribs or plat- forms. Homer describes Ulysses as building a raft with a raised platform. The ships of the Phoenicians seem to have been well built though small; they had long galleys for rowing, and for use in war, and also broader vessels for trading, probably propelled by sails. The Mariner's Compass is said, by Chinese annals, to have been made 2634 B.C. by the Emperor Ho-ang-ti, and it indicated the south instead of the north. The power of the magnet to turn always in the one direction was apparently unknown in Europe till the twelfth century. Lord Kelvin's excellent compass was patented in 1876. Mechanics and Mechanical Appliances.—Archimedes shows the power of the lever, and invents the screw of Archimedes about 266—212 b.c. The screw of Archimedes will raise water, and is still used. Wallis in 1695 says Archimedes "laid the foundations of nearly all those inventions, the further prosecution of which is the boast of our age.'' Pneumatics and early ideas about Steam as a Power.— Hero of Alexandria described methods of using steam as a power, and is said to have made a toy called the iEolopile, having properties of a steam engine, 284—241 b.c. Electricity.—The electric properties of amber, when rubbed, are said to have been known by Thales about 600 b.o. Lighthouse at Alexandria, 550 ft. high, fire on top, 285 b.c. Paper is said to have been made from the reed Papyrus in Egypt and India centuries before the birth of Christ. Brass money in use, according to Homer, about 1180 B.C. Money coined at Home 570 b.c Gold coined 206 b.c. Bells said to have been introduced in Christian churches by Paulinas, Bishop of Nola, about 400. Cotton is said to have been brought into Europe by the followers of Mahomet, about 627. (The cotton plant is indigenous to the tropical parts of America, and of India, and Herodotus mentions Indian cloth made of cotton.) Banks were first established in Italy by the Lombard Jews, 808.

The Chinese and Japanese are said to have printed Block-books before the Christian era. Koster of Haarlem has been credited with inventing block-printing about 1438, though an earlier date has been given. Printing with movable types is generally ascribed to John Gutenberg at Mentz. Faust and Shseffer -also connected with early printing, 1450. Printing introduced ■into England by William Caxton, who set up a press at West- minster Abbey, 1474.

Her speed will be over 23 knots, and she will be the biggest vessel of any kind, merchantman or war- ship, afloat. Various factors in the great developments in steamships are—the use of high pressure steam with compound, triple- expansion, and quadruple-expansion engines ; the use of steel' instead of iron, rendering the parts stronger and lighter ; the use of surface condensers, which quickly reduce the steam to hot water ready for the boiler; improvements in boilers,•■ including the water-tube boilers to raise steam quickly, con- tinuously, and at a high pressure. To these may be added' improvements in the shape of the vessel, enabling her to cut' through the water quickly. 27 Gold Medals and other Awards. S.S. "CAMPANIA."« SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. THE TIME ALL OVER THE WORLD. Time is based upon the daily rotation of the earth upon its axis in the presence of the sun, and 12 o'clock, noon, means the highest point at which the sun appears in the heavens. The further east you go, the earlier the sun rises above the horizon and the earlier it sets. As it is perplexing to have variations of time in the same or even adjacent countries, many are nbw adopting standard time, by which is meant time varying from Greenwich by whole hours. Thus Belgium and Holland use Greenwich time, and are called the Western European zone. Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Servia, Bosnia, Sweden and Denmark, are said to be in the central zone, and calculate their time one hour in advance of (i.e., later in the day), Greenwich. In France, however, the legal hour is "Paris time," which is about nine minlites later than Greenwich time. Eastern Europe—Russia, Eoumania, Bulgaria, and Rounielia— are in the eastern zone, and the standard time is two hours in advance of (i.e., later in the day), that at Greenwich. The United States and Canada also calculate their time from Greenwich, and the vast continent of North America is divided into five zones: Halifax, Nova Scotia, is in the four hours zone, its time being four hours different from that of Greenwich ; thus, twelve o'clock in London is eight o'clock in the morning at Halifax. New York and Montreal, again, are in the five hours zone, their time being five hours west of Greenwich ; twelve o'clock in London is seven o'clock in the morning at New York; Chicago is six hours west, and San Francisco eight hours west. Going east the reverse is the case, and when the time is noon at Greenwich it is about a quarter to eight in the evening at Pekin, seven minutes to six at Calc utta, twenty minutes to ten at Melbourne, five minutes pxist ten at Sydney, and about twenty minutes to twelve p-m. at Auck- land, New Zealand; and fourteen minutes past one at Cape Town. In short, by the supporters of " Standard Time " the globe is divided into zones of fifteen degrees, or one hour each, Greenwich being the centre of the zero zone, and time counting one hour later in the day than Greenwich as we go east, and one hour earlier in the day as we go west.

"To mention spring cleaning, and omit to name SUNLIGHT SOAP in connection therewith, is an error into which no woman who professes to help her less enlightened sisters in matters domestic is likely to fall. This soap is one of the-greatest aids to cleanliness and the saving of labour of the century, and it is no wonder that its success has been so. marvellous. No house should be without it, which literally brings sweet- ness and light wherever it is used,"—Prom the Lady-8 Companion, April 18th, 1896. Saves Hours of Laborious Work. " There are many thousands, nay millions, of house- wives who have learnt to consider the day on which SUNLIGHT SOAP was introduced to their notice as a red-letter one. Has it not saved them many hours of laborious work at the weekly washing-tub, besides vastly improving in colour, as well as more effectually cleansed the clothes washed with it? But this magic soap does much more than give us snow-white linen; it removes scorch, inkstains, as well aa mildew from the same, and should find a place in every kitchen, nursery, and bath-room. Indeed, it is difficult to limit the excel- lent purposes to which SUNLIGHT SOAP can be put."—From the Lady's Pictorial, May 30th, 1896. The Clothes Wear Longer. " Housekeepers will find it to their interest to see that SUNLIGHT SOAP is used in their house, as it is so labour-saving, so cleansing, and such a wonderfully wherever SUNLIGHT SOAP is found.economical soap. It is a pure make, too, therefore can be used for every part of household work, and is an excel- lent soap for laundry purposes, and especially to be recommended for washing dresses, cambric blouses, | curtains, &c, as it loosens the dirt, and does away to an I extent with rubbing; thus the clothes wear longer, and 1 they always assume a good colour, and smell so sweet and fresh."—From Weldon's Journal of Costumes for July, 1895. For Washing Flannels and Woollen Materials. " Shred as thinly as possible a tablet of SUN = / LIGHT SOAP into a tub; pour over this a gallon \ of boiling (not hot, but boiling) water; stir up I well with a stick or bunch of twigs until it is in I a foaming lather, and let it cool until the elbow can quite comfortably be borne in it. Shake the flannel- \ well to free from dust, and then put them into a tub and souse and work them well. The dirt will come out as if by magic; then rinse very thoroughly in two or even three relays of warm water; -squeeze out the water, but do not twist the flannel—this breaks the fibre (a wringer expresses the water thoroughly and is a great saver of trouble and wear and tear); then hang up to dry, not near the fire or in a very hot sun. Iron on the wrong side with a thin cotton between the flannel and the iron. Eemember the importance of rinsing thoroughly; if soap is left in the flannel it hardens it. Kubbing soap on flannel destroys it, because it knots the woollen fibre. " The reason why SUNLIGHT SOAP is the best for washing flannels is that this soap (as proved by Sir Charles Cameron's analysis) contains no ' free alkali'— i.e.., caustic soda or potash—and free alkali has a most destructive effect upon wool, which it eats into and destroys. Flannels washed with coarse, common soap are soon destroyed. "Washed as above, woollen materials will always remain soft, of a good colour, and will not shrink."— From Bow Bells of February 28th, 1896.

The great event has been the return of Dr. Nansen, the Norwegian explorer, from his researches in the Arctic Eegions and the foreshadowing which he and others have given of future enterprises in the same fascinating and difficult country; He started June, 1893, in the Fram, a vessel specially constructed to withstand the ice, and on August 13th, 1896, he was brought back to Vardo in the Windward, of the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition; He had met Mr. Jackson unexpectedly on June 17th, 1896, on an ice-floe south-east of Cape Flora. He had lost touch with the Fram, and this dramatic meeting with another explorer will rank in history with the meeting of Mr. Stanley and Dr. Livingstone in the wilds of Africa. Dr. Nansen's experiences had (briefly) been these:—The Fram left the Strait of Yvgor August 3rd, 1893, and reached the Olenek September 15th, 1893. Soon after the ship became fast in the ice and drifted with the current elowly to the north-west. This was what Nansen had expected. On March 14th, 1895, he left the ship to drift on, and with his lieutenant Johansen and dogs and kayaks set forward on the ice. Progress was most difficult; several dogs had to be killed, but the intrepid explorers reached 86 degrees 14 north latitude, i.e., about 200 miles nearer to the mysterious and tantalising North Pole than anyone else has ever reached—so far as is known. Looking north, Nansen and his companion could see nothing but eternal ice and no sign of land. They came back to Franz-Josef Land, and after encountering great hardships built a hut at the end ol August for the winter, and lived on bear's flesh chiefly. In March, 1896, they began to cross the ice to Spitzbergen and finally met Mr: Jackson, as related. Mr. Jackson brought them home in the Windward. The Fram drifted, as Nansen had expected, for some time; but at length, about the beginning of March, 1896, remained stationary, and so continued till July, 1896, when a passage was forced through the ice and the water on the north oi SUNLIGHT SOAP you find the best.154- "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. j Spitzbergen was reached. Though the expedition failed to reach the North Pol-e the scientific results are numerbys and important Dr. Nansen's view as to the direction of the Arctic current has been shown to be correct; the Polar sea has been found to be exceedingly deep, some *2,200 fathoms having been sounded in some places, while Dr. Nansen ex- presses the opinion that the frozen sea extends to the Pole. In February, 1897, he came to Britain with Mrs. Nansen and received quite a great ovation. One of his first public appearances was at a dinner of the Eoyal Society's Club on February 5th. Sir Clements Markharn, President of the Geographical Society, speaking on the daring enterprise, said that prior to his departure on the expedition, Nansen came to them and explained his plan, and drew a line across the unknown regions on one of their maps as the route he hoped to be able to take. Although it contained in the past almost insurmountable difficulties, he did exactly what he intended to do. There was no instance that he (the President) ever read of, of any man undertaking a great enterprise in all the ages that were past who had been so completely and deservedly successfid. And it was no ea?y task that Nansen had to perform. He had to decide upon many questions amidst conflicting opinions. He had to settle numerous details—a mistake in any one of which might have caused failure. How all these men ever surmounted their intolerable sufferings month after month was beyond his conception. Future .Arctic Expeditions. Dr. Nansen gave many lectures in Great Britain during the year (1897), and at a meeting of the Geographical Society toward the end of March references were made to a future expedition. "If," said he, "I should start again, the new ship I should build would be even better than the Fyam, and if a man were to spend five years in her I feel certain he would bring back observations that would repay him < many times, because he would then have a rich collection of material that would enable one to form a clear and gooa idea of the physical conditions of the North Polar regions. ' In the summer of 1897 Dr. Nansen agreed to lend the ±ram for an expedition, chiefly English, to sail to the North Polar regions, and advised the members as to route and equipment You can't do without soap!Why not get ^('NLIGHT SOAP—the Best?" SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. The Jackson=Harmsworth Arctic Expedition: This expedition has spent three winters in Franz-Josef Land, having made a settlement at Elm-wood, near to Cape Mora. Thence the members venture forth in the summer to explore and map out the regions round about. Mr. Jackson lias found an open sea which he thinks extends almost to the Pole, and has named the water Queen "Victoria Sea; land had previously been supposed to extend here. He was hoping in the summer of 1897 to sail up this sea, and by the •time these lines are before the public it is to be hoped he will liave returned safely to his winter quarters, and maybe have ■solved the mystery of the North Pole—if there be one. Other Explorations. Sir Martin Conway has explored the chief island of the Spitzbergen Group, crossing it with much difficulty, and •finding the centre broken and stony, and drifted with deep narrow valleys full of snow. There are also large glaciers. Mr. A. Trevor-Battye was of the party. Lieut. Peary has again been to Boudon Bay to complete ^ethnological collections. As to explorations in the Antartic regions, various proposals have been made by the English, an American, and a Belgian. In Asia, the source of the river Irrawaddy has been found by Prince Henry of Orleans' expedition to be three head-streams in the mountains south of Thibet. The 1' Upper Irrawaddy,'5 Prince Henry declares, is really the upper Salwin. These discoveries he made in a journey in 1896 from Indo-China to Assam, in the course of which he saw mountains more than 13,000 feet high. In the early part of 1897, Miss Mary H. Kingsley published a volume of her travels in West Africa, having visited French Congo, the Cameroons, &c. She found man- grove swamps being gradually transformed into dry land and tropical forests where the gorilla still wanders.. A curious point is that she declared previous travellers had named ■severalplaces with different native words, meaning "I don't know." Concerning Ehodesia the Hon. A.

In America, geological surveys in the United States and; Canada have been conducted, and Mr. Sullivan reports the existence of a large and fertile district beyond the Ottawa, and yielding indications of possessing mineral wealth as well as containing much timber. The Hon. J. Y. Brower has been exploring the utmost sources of the Missouri river. Mr. Brower finds its extreme source in a "hole in the summit of the Kocky Mountains " 8,000 feet high. The length of the river to "Three Forks" he estimates at 398 miles; from " Three Forks " to its meeting with the Mississippi 2,547 miles, and from this point to the mouth 1,276 miles, making its total length, i.e., of the Missouri and Mississippi, the enor- mous distance of 4,221 miles. In almost all parts of the world explorers and geographers- have been at work; among these we may notice that Mr. Graham Sandberg has examined " The great River of Thibet," and found its source in a marshy gravel between glacier- topped mountains, a spot called " the sands of the Mystic "Wheel" ; and Mr. Arthur P. Harper, Mr. Douglas Freshfield and Mr. E. A. Fitzgerald have been exploring the New Zea- land Alps. It appears not unlikely that tourists to the New Zealand glaciers may soon become as -common as visitors to the European Alps. Mr. Fitzgerald crossed through a pass in the south-west New Zealand Alps which he places at 7,180 ft. high, and also ascended Mount Sefton, about 10,360 ft. high, and called the New Zealand Matterhorn. Several of these New Zealand peaks are, it appears, over 10,000 ft. A horse track for summer use will probably be marked out from a place called the Hermitage to the New Zealand west coast, and possibly by this time is being made. These surveys have been under the auspices of the New Zealand Governments. Our fellow-subjects in Australia have also been busy, an expedition having set forth as far back as May, 1896, into the interior of their vast continental island. The explorers, who should bring back much valuable information, were not expected to return, however, until the end of 1897. SUNLIGHT SOAP will make it so.I58 " SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. In Hindustan the Indian Survey has continued its work. There are mountains on the N.W. Indian frontier rising over 20,000 ft. high. Several travellers have been busy in different parts of Central Asia, Mr, and Mrs, Littledale and Mr, Fletcher rinding determined opposition from the natives of Thibet in an attempt to reach Lhasa. One of the most startling and at the same time captivating suggestions has come from France, where certain travellers have proposed the planting of trees in the great desert of Sahara, Experiments have been made, and in valleys with a little water, trees like the acacia, the tamarisk, the eucalyptus—which is useful in medicine and sanitation—and curiously, the poplar, have been found to flourish. It is expected that under these trees fruits and .vegetables might be grown successfully. Clear-sighted men like M. Deschaud see that the very arid and barren plateaux of the desert must be left, but urge that attempts at tree raising should be made in suitable spots. Thus, from various quarters we receive news of energetic surveys and explorations, and while French, Germans, Austrians, and Norwegians are busy, we may say, without boasting that our own countrymen are not behindhand ; they show themselves worthy of the race to which belong Sir Franci3 Drake and the intrepid sea-rovers and world-explorers of the Elizabethan days.

Soon after 1840 many Dutch farmers removed here, and set up a republic, which, in 1854 was acknowledged by Great Britain as an independent State. Owing to troubles with the native tribes and the Boers, the British intervened in 1877, and annexed the country. In 1888 the Boers revolted, and after much fighting a treaty was signed, placing the country under British suzerainty. This was modified in 1884. The principal towns are Pretoria, the capital» Johannesburg, Potchefstroom, and Klerksdorf. Owing to thei great gold discoveries, numbers of English and other nationalities flowed into Johannesburg and the adjacent territory, and finding the Dutch refused them electoral rights, great discontent has prevailed.

The building of new battleships, cruisers, torpedo-boat destroyers, &c, bas been energetically pushed forward, and the Estimates in the spring of 1897 provided for the com- mencement of four battleships, three third-class cruisers, two sloops, four twin-screw gunboats, and two torpedo-boat destroyers. A new yacht for Her Majesty was also com- menced at Pembroke. Of these vessels three battleships, three cruisers, and two sloops were, or are being, built in the national dockyards; the remaining battleship, four gunboats, and two torpedo-boat destroyers have been, or are being, built by contract. The propelling machinery and boilers for all the vessels, except for two third-class cruisers and one of the sloops, have been ordered from private firms. The three battleships built in the dockyards were laid down as soon as the slips occupied in March, 1897, by the Canopus, Goliath, and Ocean, which were launched towards the end of the year, became vacant. Consequently, with those under construction in 1896, there have been, or will be, during the years 1897 and 1898 under construction or completing:—Fourteen battleships, eight first-class cruisers, nine second-class cruisers, ten third-class cruisers, two sloops, four twin-screw gunboats, fifty-two torpedo-boat destroyers, eight light-draught steamers for special service, and one Eoyal yacht,—a total of 108. Their aggregate displacement tonnage is about 380,000, and aggregate" indicated horse-power 800,000. It is anticipated that 66 of those vessels will be completed for service, including fifty torpedo-boat destroyers, before 31st March, 1898. During 1896-7 extensive experiments have been made on armour plates, the conditions embodying a higher standard than in former contracts. The results have shown that British manufacturers' plates continue to hold the same good position in relation to their foreign competitors as in the past. In March, 1897, five large first-class battleships were being built, and work has steadily proceeded on these; they are quickly, thoroughly and well.174 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. somewhat of the Renown type, but 390 feet long instead of 380 feet, and of 12,950 tons. Their names are the Canopus, Ocean, Goliath, Albion, and Glory. The speed is nearly nineteen knots. The Ocean has been completed during the year at Devonport, and the slip on which she was built has recently been prepared for another of a similar type, and by April next it is expected £10,000 will have been spent on her for wages alone* These vessels will float in two feet less of water than the celebrated Majestic class,yet they fire practically the same guns. They have all been, or will be, fitted with water- tube boilers. H.M S, " YAJESTIC. The following details, among others, concerning cruisers and other craft may also be given as among the work of the year. The 20-knot cruiser Proserpine, of 2,135 tons displace- ment which was commenced on March 2nd, 1896, has been pushed forward, and will be finished for active service before the end of this financial year (March 31st, 1898). Her total cost is estimated at £153,721. Her sister cruiser Pomone, which was laid down on December 21st, 1896, has been con- siderably advanced. The keels have also been laid of two new sloops, sheathed with copper and wood, and built upon similar lines to the Torch and Alert, each having a displaco- "SUNLIGHT SOAP never disappoints.THE NAVY. 175 ment of 960 tons, arid carrying an armament of six four-inch and four three-pounder quick-firing guns. The machinery for one of the sloops, which are to steam 13*25 knots per hour is being made at Sheerness Dockyard, the other being engined by a private firm. The new 20-knot cruisers Perseus and Prometheus, built at Hull by Earle's Shipbuilding Company, have also been sent to Sheerness Dockyard to be armed, and completed when delivered from the contractors. In addition to the above work, the yard has been kept busy by the refit of the torpedo cruiser Racoon and the sloops Acorn and Buzzard, which have returned from foreign service, and the cruisers Barracouta and Swallow, which were attached to the Medway Fleet Eeserve. At Devonport, on the slip from which the cruiser Furious was launched early in 1897, a third-class cruiser of the Proserpine type was laid down in August, and she will be completed for sea in sixteen months, and between the 31st oi March, 1897, and the end of July last, £27,000 was spent in completing the new cruisers Arrogant and Furious for sea. H.M.S. "ROl'AL SOVEREIGN.'1 The Chief Constructor also received from the contractors and completed for sea the cruiser Diadem, built at Govan; the destroyers Fervent and Zephyr, built at Paisley; the destroyers Quail, Thrasher, Virago, Earnest, Griffon, Locust, Panther, Seal, and Wolf, built at Birkenhead; the Otter and Leopard, built at Barrow-in-Furness; and the Fairy, Gipsy, and Osprey, built at Glasgow.

The Naval Statement of the First Lord of the Admi- ralty gave a Very satisfac- tory report of the new w a t er-tub e "boilers, which raise steam rapidly. In short, when the vessels now being built are com- pleted, the Navy will consist of 70 battleships and jsoasb defence ships, 55 first-class cruisers, 61 second-class cruisers, 174 third-class cruisers, and 90 torpedo-boat des- troyers ; (42 of these destroyers are of 26 to 27 knots speed, 45 of 30 knots, and 3 of 32 to 33 knots); 77 other torpedo craft of the first class, 24 other torpedo craft of the lower classes. The Navy Estimates for 1897-98 amounted to a net total of £21,838,000, as against £21,823,000 in 1896-97. The number of officers, seamen, boys, coastguard, and Eoval Marines voted for 1896-97 was 93,750, a net increase on the previous year of 4,900.

The majority were youths from 18 to 20 years of age, of good average height and stature. The standard height was main- tained at an average of 5 feet 6J inches, with an average chest measurement of 34 inches. A certain proportion were growing lads under 18, with a physical equivalent, in most cases, to that represented by the higher age. Orders were given in the spring of 1897 to the Royal Gun Factories, "Woolwich, for additional guns for the Navy of the value of £100,000. The year 1896-97 was the busiest in the Royal Gun Factories ever remembered, and the year 1897-8 promises to have been still busier when the year closes March 31st. The wages paid at the Royal Gun Factories have amounted to about £26,000 per week. The total cost of the Navy for 1897-8 is estimated at £22,780,473, an increase of £15,000 on the previous year,. The Army, The first chief point of interest in the events of the past year has been the total increase of all ranks by seme 7,385 men. These were sanctioned by Parliament in the spring of 1897 ; but some 4,700 have not been actually enlisted, though Parliament gave permission that they might be enrolled, and only some 2,600 have, in fact, been added. This gives the figures of our standing Army, exclusive of India, during the year 1897, at about 150,000 of all ranks. In addition to which over 73,000 are in India (when one regiment returns home another goes out to take its place), giving a total of the regular British Army of about 223,000 for the year. There are, further, certain other regiments abroad, bringing up the total, to about 230,000, or, if the full number permitted by Parlia- ment be recruited, to 234,473. But in addition there are the Reserve Forces, amounting in round numbers to 80,000 ; the Militia, both at home and at Malta and Bermuda, amounting to about 140,000; the Yeomanry, nearly 12,000; and the Volunteers, 263,W0, making a grand total recognised by Parliament of the Regular Army, Reserves and Auxiliaries, for 1897-8, according to the estimates of the Home, Colonial and Indian Establishments, of 718,797 men. Of this number 665,344 were reckoned to be effectives of all ranks.SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Edinburgh, 1890. «< S UN LIGHTYEAR-BOOK. Of the Eegular Army some 40,000 were in the Colonies ; 10,000 in Malta, Gibraltar, &c.; and ahout 4,250 in Egypt, while some 117,000 are in the United Kingdom, i.e., if all the increases sanctioned by Parliament are actually realized before the end of the financial year, 31st March. During the past 37 years, the increase in the Volunteer force has been steady and remarkable. Thus, in 1860, the men enrolled were about 119,000 ; during the past year they have been about 264,000., of which 236,000 were estimated to be actually effective. The total cost of the Army for the year is estimated at £18,470,535, a net increase of £98,400. Of this amount the Begular Army takes in round figures over £6,000,000, the medical establishments, £293,000 ; the Militia, £532,000; the Yeomanry Cavalry, £78,000, and the Volunteer Corps over £1,328,000. The cost of provisions and various supplies, are over %± millions, while clothing, stores, War Office expenses, non-effective charges, &c, make up the balance. In addition there was a supplementary sum of £255,300 in January, 1897. There have been the various military establishments open for educational purposes, among others at Woolwich, Sand- hurst, Chelsea, Dublin, &c. The two principal schools for officers are Woolwich and Sandhurst. There may be no Standing Army left in Britain in time of peace except by consent of Parliament, and the consent is given annually, and dates from the famous Bill of Eights in 1689. The number of troops and the amount of their <jost must be sanctioned, and the money voted annually by ^arliamenl , . i\n important change, or series of changes, lias occurred m the administration of the Army after the retirement of the Duke of Cambridge as Commander-in-Chief. ihe re- organization of the administration was authorized by an Order in Council, dated as far back as November 21st, 1895, and the duties of the chief officers were defined m a memorandum presented to Parliament in February, 1896. Lord Wolseley Who was appointed as Commander-in-Chief for a term of five years has not exactly the same duties as the late Commander- L Chief, There is now an Army Board the Commander- in-Chief being president, and the members being the Quarter-THE ARMY. [Master-General for equipment and supplies, the Adjutant- .General (for discipline, education, &c), the Inspector-General of Ordnance, and the Inspector-General of Fortifications. Each official is directly responsible to the War Secretary for the time "being who is in Parliament. Further, there is the Accountant-General, who represents the Finance Secretary. There is further a War Office Consultation Council, the Secretary of State being president. | The direct and general command rests still, however, with the Commander-in-Chief, who has with him various officials, having charge of various branches- and departments such as the Intelligence Department, the Mobilisation Service, &c. There is further a Committee of the Cabinet, or Government of the day, with seats in Parliament, for causing co-operation, &c, between the naval and military forces. The several branches of the Regular Army may thus be Summarised:— (1) Royal Artillery, sub-divided into Horse, Field, Moun- tain and Garrison Artillery; (2) Cavalry (horse-soldiers), divided into Household Cavalry and Cavalry of the Line; (3) Royal Engineers ; (4) Foot Guards ;. (5) Infantry of the Line, comprising the great bulk of the Army; (6) Service, Store and Pay Corps, and last, the Medical Staff Corps. The Reserve is composed of men who have served with the colours, and who in return for a pension are liable to be called to serve again if necessary. The terms of service are :—Long service, twelve years with the colours ; short service, seven years with the colours and five years with the Reserve. In the Foot Guards, short service is three years with the colours, and nine in the Reserve, or an additional year with the colours if abroad. A good character soldier may re-engage in his twelfth year, and after serving for twenty-one years may have a pension for life; on the other hand, a man may enlist for three years only, but should he not re-engage he is not entitled to deferred pay. Guns.—The Horse Artillery has been re-armed with a new twelve-pounder cannon weighing only 12 cwt., and having steel wire bound over the inner core, thus making the weapon at once lighter and yet stronger. The new wire guns for Horse Artillery are believed to be superior to any foreign weapon of SUNLIGHTToAPTGoi^Medd, Jamaica, 189lT~xob "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK.

Wire guns are also made for fortresses, some guns being 38 feet long. The question of quick-firing guns and machine guns have also largely occupied the minds of ordnance authorities, and it is said that the Maxim will discharge between 600 and 700 rounds in one minute.

SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Ghent, 1889, A Perfect Boon in the Household. Trinity School House, Brompton, Chatham. Dear Sirs,—I feel I must write to you to express the pleasure and satisfaction I have found from the use of your SUNLIGHT SOAP. I have been for some weeks without a servant, and having to do a great deal of the housework myself, I can personally bear testimony to the value of your soap. I consider it to be the best in the market, not only for washing clothes, but for clean- ing purposes and removing grease; it makes a lather more rapidly than any other soap I have ever used. I shall recommend it to all my friends, and do all I can to inorease the sale of it, as I consider it a perfect boon in the household. I am, Yours truly, Ellen "Wainwright. For Washing Everything. " Braeside," Eastern Eoad, Eortis Green, N. Gentlemen—We use SUNLIGHT SOAP for every- thing—house cleaning, washing of linen, carpets, silver, silk and woollen dresses, and kid gloves—and find it superior to any other soap for these as well as for the toilet. Yours truly, M. Ellis-Good. No Rough Hands. Eadley Hall, Southwell. Gentlemen,—I have much pleasure in stating that I have used SUNLIGHT SOAP for the last seven years, and although I have tried many other kinds, I find none to equal yours. After washing, the clothes are a splen- did colour and could not be whiter. To show its good qualities, there are no rough hands after using it. 1 find it invaluable, and would not on any account be without it. Believe me, Yours truly, M. Iinley.SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Lyons, 1894. It Simply Does Wonders. Llanrwst, North Wales. Gentlemen-,—I feel I must write and tell you how de- lighted I am with SUNLIGHT SOAP. It simply does wonders. For washing flannels and silks I find it par- ticularly good, and coloured articles look like new after being washed with it. I have also used it as a Toilet Soap and find it very good. It also greatly minimises labour; in fact, it is an excellent soap, and I have much pleasure in recommending it to all my friends. Yours very truly, R. A. Praise Where Praise is Due. Wingham, Kent, Dec. 9th, 1896. Dear Sirs, — Just a line to speak of your excellent soap. I have used it for the last five years, and find it the best and cheapest soap you can get. I take in washing, and can do more in two days by using SUNLIGHT SOAP than some can do in a week. I give praise where praise is due. I am, Yours respectfully, Mrs. An/sell. For Washing Surplices. Wingham Vicarage, Dover. Jan. 4th, 1892. Dear Sirs,—Just before our late Church Festival, I found the surplices of our choir unwashed. In my anxiety that they should be got ready, I spoke to our churchwarden, and he said : " It is too late, they cannot be washed now." Then I went to the laundress, and she told me the same thing—that there was not time to prepare the surplices before they would be wanted—and then I said to her, " Don't worry. Happy thought, use SUNLIGHT SOAP," and I am glad to inform you that my suggestion was successful, and the result very satisfactory. All the surplices were made perfectly white and clean, and the bright appearance of the choir was a pleasing feature of our festival services. I remain, Yours faithfully, J. M. Fox."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK* ^Literature* EVENTS OF 1896=7. History. If there has "been no great epoch-making "book published during the year, there has been an abundance of good, sound, wholesome literature—much of it of a very high average. Concerning history, it may be mentioned that Dr. W. 8. Aubrey has completed his "Bise and Growth of the English Nation," and Messrs. Longmans have been engaged upon a new edition of Lord Macaulay's Life and "Works, the issue of which has been completed in about six months. The tendency now, however, is to write history in periods, or in episodes. So we have the " Courtships " of Queen Elizabeth treated by Major Martin Hume with regard to the political affairs of her reign. Another volume of a some- what similar kind has been " The Year after the Armada." English people may be pardoned if they never tire of that glorious period of our national history. Among other volumes of history the Kev. W. N. Hutton has issued an illustrated volume of the " Church of the Sixth Century," and Mr. H. D. Traill has reached the sixth volume of his "Social England." The Eev. William Urwick has published another volume of Nonconformist histories, the present being "Nonconformity m Worcester." The "History of Our Own Times, by Mr. Justin McCarthy, M.P., has been brought up to 1897, in another volume, and now forms a history of the sixty years of the Queen's reign. Both history and biography aro SUNLIGHT SOAP MK. JUSTIN Mc CAKTHY. CAPTAIN JIAHAN.185 LITERATURE. represented in Captain Mahan's "Life of Nelson," published in 1897 by Sampson Low & Co. Captain Mahan has become very favourably known as a writer on naval matters, and the influence of power at sea, and various volumes of his really form a naval history up to about the year 1814. To these volumes must be added Mr. Headlam's " Founda- tion of the German Empire," and Mr. Stillnian's "Italy from 1815," both works in the Cambridge Historical Series; while the British Colonies have been represented by Australia in the Early Days," by Mr. Marcus Clarke; and General Meredith Eead has produced two volumes of historic studies in Yaud, Berne and Savoy, which have been published by Messrs. Chatto & YVindus, and illus- trated by thirty full-page pictures. Biography. Turning now to biography, a notable volume has been Sir Joshua Fitch's "Dr. and Matthew Arnold, and their Influence on Education," published by Mr. Heinemann in the Great Educator's series, Mr. Andrew Lang's " Life and Letters of Lockhart," the " Life and Letters of Eomanes," Mr. W. H. Wilkins's Life of Lady Burton, entitled, "The Eomance of Isabel, Lady Burton," partly written by her- self ; Mr. J. D. Hilton's "Life of Mrs. Hilton" (his mother), who founded the creche system in England, published by Isbister and Co.; Mr. Clement K. Shorter's "Charlotte Bronte;" "The Life and Correspon- dence of Archbishop Magee " (Bishop of Peterborough and later, Archbishop of York); and though not strictly, or simply a biography—may also be added the " Ethics of John Stuart Mm," by Dr. Charles Douglas, Lecturer m Moral Philosophy at Edin- burgh University. The "Life of AKDEEW LANG. MR. CLEMENT K. SHORTEB. makes linen whiter and homes brighter."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. Froebel,'1' the great Educational Reformer, has also been written by Miss Fanny Franks, and published by Swan Sonnenschein. Progress has also been made with the monumental " Dictionary of National Biography," the end of which is now in sight. Planned to occupy some fifty volumes, the fiftieth only saw the work hardly half through the letter " S," and we suspect six more volumes will be needed to complete Z. The great work is certainly ably and admirably done, bringing together a mass of new, and on the whole, valuable and informing biographies of persons who have become more or less famous in our national annals. Philosophy and Theology. One very notable event in the more grave and serious branches of English literature has been the issue of the concluding volume (the third) of Mr. Herbert Spencer's " Principles of Sociology," which completes his system or scheme of Synthetic Philosophy, volume has been Mr. Gladstone's "Studies Subsidiary to the "Works of Bishop Butler;" studies which were papers written at different times, but now collected in one volume. Dean Farrar has also issued a remarkable book, upon which he has been engaged for years, viz., "The Bible: its Mean- ing and Supremacy," in which he points out'' the dangerous errors which have sprung from the misinterpretation " of Scripture, " and from humanly invented theories as to the nature of their in- spiration." The Duke of Argyll, author of the well-know a " Eeign of Law," has produced a volume entitled •' The Philosophy of Belief, or Law in Chris- tian Theology," and apropos of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, Messrs. dean faerar. SUNLIGHT SOAP MB. HERBERT SPENCER. Another noticeableLITERATURE. Skeffington & Co. issued a volume of Original Sermons by Dean Farrar, Canon Hammond, the Eev. H. J. "Wilmot Buxton, the Eev. J. B. C. Murphy, Chaplain to the Forces, and the Key. Mr. Booker, of Dorking. Mr. Lecky's " Democracy and Liberty " has been considerably criticised, though it is un- deniably a great work ; while those who desire to begin the systematic study of philosophy will no doubt find Dr. Knight's ^ Introduction to Philosophy " interesting and valuable. Travel and Adventure. Volumes of travel and adventure have been abundant, and South African affairs have found representation in Mr. D. F. Dutort's " Ehodesia," published in the spring by Mr. Heinemann. Mr. Dutort is an Afrikander by birth, and "in full sympathy with the spirit of local development as opposed to Imperial control," but is nevertheless "a.strong advocate of Mr. Ehodes's policy in Ehodesia, since the Chartered Company was established." Dealing with another part of Africa was Slatin Pacha's "Fire and Sword in the Soudan," forming an important addi- tion to this class of literature, and almost rivalling Dr. Nansen's book on his Arctic Explorations and Travels. Concerning this book it may be stated that its pre- paration is said to have tried the dis- tinguished writer more severely than even the arctic dangers and travels about which he wrote. Honourable mention must also be made of Mrs. Ernest Hart's " Picturesque Burmah, Past and Present," which has been issued^ by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. It contains some 400 pages with over eighty reproductions of sketches and photographs and a couple of maps. Mrs. Hart is a lady traveller who journeyed the whole length of the land from Eangoon to Bhamo, "up and down the reaches of the noble Irrawaddy Eiver," and studied the lives, customs, manners, ideas and" characters of tne Burmese. They seem to be among the most genial and interesting people of the Orient. makes light work of a heavy wash. SLATIN rACHA.r% * SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. Novels and Stouies. Fiction, however, still holds the highest place for abundance and popularity. Everybody nowadays reads "stories," as -perhaps everybody always did—when stories could be got to read. The reason is not far to seek: writers and readers both recognise the value of Tennyson's line that fiction so called— is often " Truth embodied in a tale." Olive Schreiner doubt- less endeavoured to do this in her novel, or rather sketch, " Trooper Peter Halkett," which she published in the early part of 1897. In it she strove to impeach Mr. Ehodes and .the Chartered Company and the action of British troopers in Ehodesia. On the other hand, however, in Ella MacMahon's story—" The Touchstone of Life "—Mr. Ehodes is represented •as the great pioneer of new lands and the creator of new empires. , Mrs. Humphry "Ward has endeavoured to deal witn some of the Socialist problems in her " Sir George Tressady." Mr. Du Maurier, whose death, alas, we mourn, has followed his amazingly successful " Trilby_" with "Martian," and Mr. Eudyard Kipling has left India m his new work, " Slaves of the Lamp." In his " Child of the Jago " Mr. Arthur Morrison shows an improvement on his " Tales of Mean Streets," and in his strong and vivid depic- tion of scenes in slumdom is almost without a rival. Mr. Anthony Hope has been better than ever in his Comedies of Courtship,'' and m his " Heart of Princess Osra," he is stiR very successful, though in a different style; while a third from his pen has been the curiously named "Phroso." One of the most popular of books, however, has been Mr. J. M. Barrie's "SentimentalTommy" —a story which has enjoyed enormous vogue. He followed it up with another volume entitled "Margaret Ogilvy/ which was in fact a biography of Ins mother. Mr. Harold Frederic's "Illu- mination " has also been exceedingly popular and has greatly advanced Ins reputation ; while Mrs. Hodgson Bur- ™m-'q "T.ndv nf Qualitv" has likewise MB. J. M. BAJRRIE. nett's "Lady of Quality enjoyed much vogue. SUNLIGHT SOAPLITERATURE. Colonial stories are making their welcome appearance, and when well done, as in Mr. Louis Becke's " South-Sea Stories " and Mr. Joseph. Conrad's " Outcast of the Islands," win great attention and approval, as witness also Mr. Eolf Boldrewood's- Australian books, and Mr. Marcus Clarke's " Stories of Aus- tralia." Anglo-Indian life has been represented by Mrs. F. A. Steel's "Face of the Waters," and by Miss Alice Kipling's^ " Pinchbeck Goddess." Miss Kipling is a sister of Mr. Eudyard Kipling, and her married name is Mrs. Fleming. Mrs. F. A. Steel has added to her reputation by her story, the " Gift of the Gods," which appeared originally in CasseU's Magazine. Admirers of Mrs. Hungerford's stories have welcomed her well-known light and humorous touch in her last book, " Lovice," mingled with t regret at her lamented death ; and Annie S. Swan has issued her novel of a lady doctor under the title of " Mrs. Keith Hamilton, M.B." " Ouida " in her new book, " The Massarenes," has returned from Italy and scathingly satirizes some phases of London fashionable society. We need hardly add that good and wholesome stories, and books for boys and girls and young people have appeared, in plenty, among the writers being George Manville Fenn,. G. A. Henty, Eobert Leighton, F. M. Holmes, Harry Colling- wood, L. T. Meade, Evelyn Everett Green, Dr. Gordon Stables^. E. Harcourt Burrage, Eliza Pollard, &c. Poetry. The Poet Laureate, Mr. Alfred Austin, has issued a volume, " The Conversion of Winckelmann, and other Poems," in which he shows he can sing with a sweeter and stronger note than some folks thought when he burst forth into verse shortly after his appointment. Mr. Swinburne has been represented by his poem, the "Tale of Balen," showing much of his remarkable MB' ALFBED AUSTI^- power, and Mr. Eudyard Kipling's "Seven Seas," and Mr. John Davidson's "New Ballads" have both been notable books, and will certainly maintain if not add to their writers' reputation. Connected with English poetry are a couple of makes homes brighter and hearts lighter.rtgo " SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. "SUNLIGHT SOAP is made in a twin bar volumes, issued in George Bell & Sons' new series of Hand- books of English Literature—viz., " The Age of Tennyson," by Professor Hugh Walker, and "The Age of Milton," by Messrs. Mullinger & Masterman. Miscellaneous. There remain several very interesting and valuable books to notice dealing with politics, industrial questions, natural history, and other topics, descriptive, informing, and worth reading. In the early spring six Oxford men sent forth a volume entitled " Essays in Liberalism," which showed that a genuine movement in favour of Liberalism has been pro- ceeding in the ancient University, but that there are those who draw a clear distinction between Liberalism aud Socialism. Connected with Labour questions also was Mr. Charles Booth's seventh volume on " London Labour and the London poor »_a monumental work, which forms a perfect store- house of facts on this important question, and will probably rank as one of the most complete and reliable authorities on the social condition of our time. ^ ■ Probably umsurpassed in its own particular department is Messrs. "Warne's " Favourite Flowers of Garden and Green- house," edited by Mr. Edward Step-who has become so well known as a popular writer on floriculture and botany, &c.-- and Mr. William Watson, of Kew Gardens This is probably flue most complete popular book in English on this attractive subject, and as it appeared in cheap weekly parts it has been within the reach of people with s ender purses Even the window gardeners of London will find valuable hints in it about the propagation and successful management ot their beloved plants.

Glancing at science, we may notice that a new edition of Page's Introductory Text book on Geology—one of the most successful and popular works of the kind ever written—has been issued by Messrs. Blackwood; it has been revised and enlarged by Professor Lap worth, and Messrs. Blackwood have also issued an enlarged and re-written edition of Mackay's Elements of Physiography. Mr. F. M. Holmes has added the cheap and popular volumes entitled " England's Navy 'J and the " Marvels of Metal" to his list of popular narrative books on the triumph of Engineers, the Lords of the Admiralty having given him a special permit to inspect Chatham Dockyard for the purpose of the Navy book, and Mr. Walter Jerrold has also issued, through the same publishers, Messrs. Partridge & Co., an admirable volume on "The Triumphs of the Printing Press." Mr. John C. Sparkes, Principal of the Art Training School, South Kensington, and Mr. Gandy (of Doulton'e) have also written an excellent volume on "Potters, the Arts and Crafts." It is historical, biographical and descriptive, and conveys much reliable information on the art of pottery in an interesting manner. & [ Professor George Saintsbury has also written a volume on the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of European Literature his subject being « The Flourishing of Romance and the Eise of Allegory," This volume forms one of a new series of books on Periods of European Literature, issued by Messrs.

NEWSPAPERS OF THE WORLD. There are now about 2,500 daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, the number sixty years ago, when Queen Victoria began her reign, having been only about 300. The number now published throughout the world is almost incalculable, nearly every little western township m the United States, for instance, having its broadsheet. In England the "London Weekly Courant was published in James I.'s reign, about 1622, and may be regarded as the first English newspaper, the " English Mercurie," said to have been published in 1588, and professing to give accounts of the Spanish Armada, having been shown to be forgeries. In 1663 Sir Roger L'Estrange established the " Public Intelligencer," and after a couple of years it ceased when the t( London Gazette," which is still published, was issued in 1665 ; the « Times " first published, 1788 ; the « Morning. Post," 1772; the "Observer," 1791 ; the '' Morning Adver- tiser," 1794 ; the " Globe," 1803 ; and numerous other papers rapidly followed whose names are now "household words" all the world over. Australia. In the. earlier years of the century the newspaper press in Australia was subjected to a strict censorship by the Colonial authorities, but gradually obtained its freedom and with greater liberty the numbers increased. The " Sydney Morning Herald," established in 1831, obtained a largo measure of support; the "Sydney Times" was founded in the same year; the "Australasian Chronicle" in 1839, and the "Atlas," an exceedingly able paper, in 1844. To this for the sake of quality. H194 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP is made in a special manner latter, Mr, Kobert Lowe, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke, used to contribute. Since tbose days the progress^ has been rapid, and there are now a vast number of local journals as well as the great morning dailies of large and general circula- tion. In Yictoria, the first paper in Melbourne Was the " Melbourne Advertiser," issued Jan. 1st, 1838. At Adelaide are the « Advertiser" (1858), the "Kegister" (1836), the " Express " (1863), the " Observer " (1843), &c. The country districts are well supplied. Similar remarks apply to the newspapers of other Australasian Colonies—Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia, and New .Zealand. Among them are the<£ Brisbane Courier " (1846), " The Eockhampton Morning Bulletin," the "West Australian," published at Perth, and the " Daily News." In New Zealand are, among many others, the "New Zealand Times," the "Otago Daily Times," and the "New Zealand Herald," while in Tasmania the "Hobart Mercury" is probably the leading paper; the u Tasffianian News " is the evening paper. India. Newspaper enterprise is also to the fore in India. There are a large number of Anglo-Indian journals, among the chief dailies being the "Englishman," the "Statesman," the "Indian Daily News," the "Pioneer," &c. In addition a large native press has arisen, but the circulation of some "journals " scarcely rises beyond a thousand copies. South Africa. . The Press had its early struggles here, as in other places; but it had, perhaps, special difficulties. The Dutch and English disliked each other—to uso no stronger word—and the natives disliked both. But the Press has triumphed, and there are now a large number of daily and other papers issued. The "Graham's Town Journal" was, perhaps, the first Cape paper, founded about 1820, and is now the oldest English paper in South Africa. The " Cape Argus,' founded 1857, is another of the chief journals, also the "Cape Times, 1876. Natal, the Transvaal, &c, have aU now newspapers, many, of course, being local. The " Moemfontem Express is bi-lingual, Buluwayo has three papers already, one of which is the " Matabele Times." _____195 NEWSPAPERS OF THE WORLD. United States and Canada. Here we have, indeed, a perfect army of newspapers; the names alone would occupy pages. There are the "New York Times," the "New York Herald," the "New York Sun," "World," "Tribune," &c.; the "Brooklyn Eagle," the " St. Louis Globe Democrat," the " Boston Advertiser," "Eecord," "Globe," "Herald," and " Journal,"_ while the " Youth's Companion," a weekly publication, is said to circu- late nearly half-a-miilion copies weekly. One of the most curiously named papers is the Philadelphia " Evening Call." Some of the American papers have methods of setting out extraordinarily sensational headlines to their news and their articles, which, happily, are largely avoided by our more sober-minded English journalises. In Canada, tho "Toronto Globe" (morning, evening, and weekly editions), "Mail" and "World," the "Evening News," "Evening Star," and " Evening Telegraph," the "Montreal Gazette," " Herald " and " Witness " (all daily and weekly), are among the leading papers. It is significant of the fact that tho Erench language is still spoken in parts of Canada that to many journals have Erench names, thus: "Le Courier du Canada," " L'Electeur," " L'Evenement," " La Justice," &c. Among the Quebec dailies in English are the "Morcury," the " Morning Chronicle," and the " Telegraph." Continental. An enormous number of newspapers of all kinds are now issued on the •Continexit of Europe. There are more than sixty daily political papers published in Paris alone, among which may be mentioned the " Debats," the "Eigaro," the "Petit Journal," the "Gaulois," &c. In addition there are a large number of weekly papers of various kinds, while the principal provincial papers may be counted by scores. Similar remarks would apply to other-countries, even little Holland making a good show. In Eussia the censorship is still rigid. Among some of the best-known continental papers in addition to France are :—" Tagblatt" (Berlin); "Norddeutsche Allegemeine Zeitung" (German); "Neue Ercie Presse " (Vienna); " Independence Beige " (Brussels); " Eanfulla " (Eome) ; " Norvoje Wremja" (" The New Time") St. Petersburg; " OsmanischePost" (Constantinople); &c. for the sake of effectiveness.

A good letter is like a good introduction—it tends to recom- mend the writer. The paper and envelope should bre suit- able and good, and the writing clear and distinct, without an abundance of fancy nourishes on the one hand, or slovenliness on the other. Most of all, the composition—for business letters especially—should be simple, direct, and to the point. Particular attention should be paid to Spelling. Every word should bo accurately spelt, and all the capital letters in their proper places; nor should capitals be written instead of the ordinary letters, nor unevenness be permitted between" SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. lines. All blots and smudges should be avoided, the lines should run straight across the page, and nothing of an untidy or scrawling character be permitted, otherwise the letter will tend to look vulgar and negligent. Next, a hint as to Composition. Do not use too many con- junctions, such as "ands"or "buts"or " ifs." Some, of course, are at times essential, but too many, especially if the letter be not properly punctuated, tends to run on the letter into one long, involved sentence. Especially in a business letter, remember to have something definite to say, and then say it as clearly and as briefly as possible. Ease and natural- ness of expression are also to be cultivated, but absolute clearness should be especially considered. Great attention should also be paid to Grammar. There are several simple rules of grammar which should be remem- bered, such as " The verb 'to be' takes the same case after as before it," and "The relative pronoun should agree with its nominative in number and person." Furthermore, a sentence should, if possible, never end with a preposition. Slangy words and expressions should be avoided, as also should too pedantic and pretentious words. Of course, when writing to friends or to intimate acquaintances, less constraint may be exhibited, but as a rule it is always best to avoid slipshod writing and the idea that " anything will do." The form of the letter is also important. The third person is more formal than the first person, yet some letter-writers will commence in the third person and end with the first, as, for instance, " Mrs. So-ad-So desires Mr. Butcher to send a sirloin of beef by ten o'clock, and if it be not here to time / will return it." The third person should, of course, be used throughout, and a more suitable ending would be "And should it not arrive in time she [or Mrs. So-and-So] will be obliged to return, it, as it will be of no use to her." The Style op Address is also very important. Sometimes letters have to be addressed to persons of distinction, of rank and of title, or thuse to whom you are not known or but very slightly known. In addressing such, it is proper to commence simply " Sir "or " Madam." If to some extent you know them, the SUNLIGHT SOAP supplies199 THE ART OF LETTER-WRITING. the largest demand in the world. style should be "Dear Sir" or ''•Dear Madam/' A further stage of knowledge or intimacy may "be "My Dear Sir " or " My Dear Madam." Further still we get on to " My Dear Mr. Smith " or simply " Dear Mr. Smith," and the same for ladies if the strength of the acquaintance should warrant it; and further still, in the case of gentlemen, you may say " My Dear Smith." For relatives, or in cases of very in- timate acquaintance, the Christian name may "be employed, as "My Dear Frank." For titled Personages certain forms of address are considered right and proper, and a gentleman or lady should seek to employ them. Thus:—■ To the Queen. Address: " To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty," or, " To Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria." Commence, "May it please your Majesty [or Madam]," and say " your Majesty " instead of " you " in the letter, and conclude, "I remain, Madam, with profound veneration, your Majesty's moBt faithful subject and dutiful servant."

The deaths of two Presidents of the Eoyal Academy—Lord Leighton and Sir John Millais—with the decease of such musicians as Sir Joseph Barnby and Brahms, and of such a portrait painter as George Eichmond, E.A., and such an artist and poet as William Morris, rank among the more prominent and the sadder events of the year. The Academy of 1897 was notice- able rather for the work of younger men than for that of Eoyal Academi- cians whose right it is to have their pictures hung in favourable places " on the line." Nevertheless there has been good work from Sir E. J. Poynter, the President, and many other distinguished members. There were a large number of portraits, both by professedly por- trait painters and by those who usually exercise their art in other directions. But, on the other hand, the year cannot be called, we fear, conspicuous for great imaginative Works—Mr. Dicksee, R.A., however, is represented by a great work that may be described as imaginative—it is "The Eise of Dawn." Eosy fingered stands the Dawn as a lovely girl; below roll the grey mists, and amid them the dark figure of Night, with sorrowful face, is seen descending and depart- ing before the rising light. It is a lovely picture, and one to remember in connection with the year 1897. Beautiful Scotch scenes from the brush of Mr. MacWhirter, E.A., give us views of the Waters of Glen Affanc—one up and the other down the glen. In a third canvas he takes us to Ehone Valley in early summer, and in yet a fourth— a weirdly imaginative picture, he illustrates a scene from Browning: Childe Eolaud, alone and armed, coming to the 6IH E. J. POYNTEB.FINE ARTS. 20$ dark and weird tower. The angry sunset depicted here is a very fine piece of work. Mr. David Murray, A.E.A., in some fine pictures from Hampstead. Heath, showed the ordinary wearied Londoner what beauties may lurk in the scenery at his door, while in another picture he takes us north of the Tweed, and shows us a reach of the Dee in early winter. Mr. Alfred Parsons, exhibiting for the first time as a member, depicted a beauteous Cumberland landscape, which offers opportunity for some fine colouring. Mr. Solomon, A.E.A., has finished his large picture for the decoration of the Eoyal Exchange, London, viz., the historical " Visit of Charles I. to the City in search of the Five Members," and in the Academy he exhibited a mediaeval scene, circular in shape, in which a knight is beheld riding up for his reward after unhorsing his adversary, and is baffled in obtaining it. A portrait of " Miss Donaldson," by Mr. Oolin Hunter, A.E.A. besides three pictures of Helmsdale from the far north, and Mr. Shannon's portrait of Mr. Clare Sewell Head, •which is for the Norwich Town" Hall, have been among the fine portraits of the year. Another portrait, by Mr. Shannon, viz:, " Monsignor Nugent," painted for the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, is also' memorable, and showed Mr. Shannon as an excellent colourist. Another portrait is that of Sir John Hibbert, another is Mrs. Buxton, and yet another is that of Lady Granby. Mr. Melton Fisher has found many admirers for his bright and gay " Children's Picnic." Among others are* Mr. Draper's "Calypso's Isle," and Mr. Collier's " Gwenever's Maying" (from" Sir Thomas Mallory's Chronicle), while Mr. Collier scored perhaps an even greator success with his picture of the " Game of "Whist" 'f the attitudes and faces are so expressive that you can almost tell the card each has to play. Mr. Peter Graham, E.A., has added two mora fine sea pictures from the "north countrie" to his noble list, and Mr. Farquharson has painted a flock of sheep in a Scotch snowstorm among the hills so exceedingly well that you feel almost transported to the scene when you look at it. _ Most people no doubt would agree that one of the attrac- tions of the 1897 Academy was Mr. Boughton's " Christmas Eve Four Hundred Years Ago." The midnight sexier has 27 Gold Medals and other Awards,"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 311st ended and the people are trooping out into the snow. It is an English picture full of beauty and full of feeling. Mr. Boughton was elected to the vacant E.A. chair left by the election of Sir John Millais to the Presidency. The duties of Sir E. J. Poynter's new office as President hindered his work as artist, and he was represented in the Academy by two small pictures, both classical subjects, one, an illustration to the Odes of Horace, and a portrait of Mr. Sidney Colvin. Mr.'Tadema, R.A., has produced ano/her of his Boman pictures entitled " Wandering Moments," and Mr. Gow, E.A., another incident in the Life of Napoleon. Mr. Marks, E.A.., has been represented by the picture of an old taxidermist who has just stuffed a small kfeet very much to bis own content, and Mr. Ernest Crofts, E.A., has depicted, with much spirit, an attack on Hougoumont in the world- famous battle of Waterloo. Mr. Dendy Sadler's "Counter- pane/' Mr. Buugess's picture of peasant women at a mother's meeting in an English rural parish, Mr. Alfred East's depictions of French scenery, Mr. Cope's portraits—one a full length of the Duke of Cambridge for the United Service Club,—and Mr. Yeats's portrait of Mrs. Burnet have also been features in the picture production of the year. Many English artists also exhibited in the art section of the Belgian Exhibition. Though there were no extraordinarily striking pictures at the Boyal Society of British Artists W the -spring, there wals very much good and interesting work of a high average of merit. Mr. B. Greniniell Hutchinson sent " When Winds are Blowing/' telling of scant hope in the fisherman's cottage for the fisherman's return. Mr. Wyke Bayliss, the President, sent a picture of the Baptistry of Siena Cathedral, and Mr. ft. Hillyard Swin- stead a fine portrait of Miss Amy "Scar- borough. Mr. Edmund Fuller sent "In Tow"—a beautiful sea picture, in striking contrast to a work also s:a e. burne-jones. worthy of praise, Mr. Noble Barlow's tranquil « Dorset Meadows." Among other events connected, with Artmay be mentioned See smiling faces all around,MUSIC. 207 the opening of the fine National Portrait Gallery by its donor, Mr. Alexander. Mr. G. F. Watts has given it sixteen portraits of famous men of the time, including one of the late Lord Leighton. Sir Edward Burne-Jones's water-colour, "Merlin and Nemiie," has been added to the Art Galleries of the South Kensington Museum. The Gallery of British Art has been opened, and the Clergy and Artists' Association has been formed. Mr. Thornycroft's marble statue of the Queen has been placed at the Eoyal Exchange, and Mr. Birch's statue of Her Majesty in Queen Victoria Street. Statues of Bright and Granville have been placed in the Central Hall, Houses of Parliament. Several new pictures have enriched the National Gallery and the Glasgow Corporation Gallery. The Scottish Academy, the Liverpool Exhibition, the Show of the Birming- ham Society, &c, were considered very attractive, while the gallery erected at Newlyn, in Cornwall, was well used by the painters who have made Cornwall their home. Perhaps a stronger tendency than before has marked the year for artists iio work more and more in the country. Personalia.—The unprecedented fact that three artists have held the Presidency of the Boyal Academy has occurred. Lord Xeighton died January 25th, 1896; Sir John Millais waa •elected as his successor February 25th, 1896, but he died on August 13th, 1896 ; and Mr. (now Sir) E. J. Poynter waa chosen to follow him on November 4th. Mr. Solomon J. Solomon and Mr. E. A. Abbey have been returned as A.R.A.'s, Mr. Cope beingproxime accessit (the nearest) after Mr. Abbey, and perhaps by this time is now elected. Mr. Ernest Crofts won the membership vacated by Mr. Stacy Marks, and Mr. Jackson has also become P.A. Mr. Yeames, R.A., has been appointed Curator of the Painted Hall, Greenwich Hospital, and also Librarian of the Poyal Academy. MUSIC. No decline can be chronicled in the support given to musio and musicians. Music is perhaps the most popular of the arts, if we exclude varied forms of literary art. Great concerts and performances of oratorios have drawn large audiences, while musical plays are exceedingly popular. The Handel Festival at the Crystal Palace also fell due in the summer of 1897—a not inappropriate " function" in the Queen's Diamond wherever SUNLIGHT SOAP is found.208 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. Jubilee Year. The deaths of Sir Augustus Harris and Mr. Henry E. Abbey, as impressarios, had, no doubt, a depressing effect, but not permanently so. The demand for light and bright sparkling operatic music or musical plays—as witness the long run of " The Geisha " at Daly's—has been a very marked feature, and the demand has been amply supplied by a great variety of pieces. There have been, for instance, the successful production of "His Majesty" at the Savoy, by F. C. Burnand and R. C. Lehmann, with music by A. C. Mackenzie; "The Yashmak, a Story of the East," at the Shaftesbury; "La Poupee" at the Prince of Wales's; " Shamus O'Brien," at the Opera Comique; and others. Songs from such musical plays have been very popular. The Jubilee of the first perform- ance of Mendelssohn's "Elijah" having occurred in 1896, that much-admired work has been rendered by choral associations almost everywhere, and its pop- ularity seems if possible to stand higher than ever. The famous London choirs—the "Eoyal" at the Albert Hall, and the " Queen's Hall" at that spacious and elegant rival to the Albert Hall, and the Philharmonic Society at Queen's Hall, have given familiar com- jean de beszke. positions with continued success; while the Bach Choir produced at the Queen's Hall Burneau's new "Requiem," and the Handel Society gave Handel's " Horcules " at the People's Palace, where the great master's "Messiah" draws enormous crowds. The 174th gathering of the Three Choirs at Worcester has been held, and Sheffield has commenced a Musical Festival, where high- class works have been performed. Norwich Festival has presented a novelty in Signor Luigi Mancinelli's " Hero and Leander" and Professor Stanford's new Irish ballad, " Phaudrig Crohore," one of Sheridan Le Fanu's poems. Bristol Musical Festival was also very successful. Search North, South, East or West,MUSIC. 209 Wagner's wonderful and niuch-debated music seems in- creasing in vogue, and a performance of " Tristan and Isolde," arranged for by the late Sir Augustus Harris—j though he did not live to witness it—was perhaps the best yet given in England of this work. Among the principal singers were Madame Albani and Jean de Eeszke : the rendering of Tristan by the famous Polish tenor being of very great ex- cellence. Personalia.—Dr. J. F. Bridge, organist of Westminster Abbey and Gresham Professor, has been ap- pointed to fill the vacancy of con- ductor of the Eoyal Choral Society, left by Sir A. 0. Mackenzie. Mr. W. H. Cummings has been appointed Principal of the Guildhall School of Music. Mr. Maurice Grau has been appointed director at the Coven t Garden Opera House. Mr. Leonard Borwick has well maintained his position as one of the first of English pianists, and at a large "Irish Night" concert at the Albert Hall on March 17th, 1897 given by Mr. William Carter's choir, and a selection of solo^ singers, a little girl of fourteen, one of Mr. Carter's pupils, made an excellent appearance as a soprano vocalist. Mr. Enghen d'Albert, the pianist, has made his reappearance in England after fourteen years' absence. Among deaths we have to chronicle Sir Joseph Barnby (who was knighted August, 1893), January 28th, 1896, aged 58; Henry E. Abbey, October 16th, 1896 ; Ambrose Thomas, author of "Mignon," February 12th, 1896, aged 85; Sir Augustus Harris, June 22nd, 1896, aged 44; Henry D.

J Why not get SUNLIGHT SOAP—the Best ?MY WAY OF USING THE SUN- LIGHT SOAP. " Being compelled to do my own washing, and being in delicate health, it was simply 1 killing me' hy the old method and with ordinary laundry soap. By using the SUNLIGHT SOAP in the following way I get my clothes beautifully white and clean, and without tiring myself in the least. First, then, I dip one of the gar- ments in the tub of water, draw it out on the Wash- board, and rub the soap over it lightly, being particular to soap all the soiled places. I then roll it in a tight roll, just as a piece is rolled after it is sprinkled for iron- ing and lay it in the bottom of the tub, under the water, and go on until all the pieces have the soap rubbed on them and are rolled up. I then go away —from thirty minutes to an hour—and pay my atten- tion to some light employment about the house, letting the SUNLIGHT SOAP do its work.

If you wish your linen to be as white as snow,HOW TO WASH AND PRESERVE FLANNELS. By LOUISA E. SMITH, Authoress of " Home Washing1," and Instruc- tress at the Forsyth Technical College. It is necessary, before commencing to wash flannels, to prepare a jelly of SUNLIGHT SOAP, as soap must not be rubbed on these articles. Cut up a tablet of SUNLIGHT SOAP, put the pieces into a stewpan with a quart of water, let them simmer for half an hour, or remain in the oven all night. When cold it should resemble a strong jelly. The properties of SUNLIGHT SOAP help to soften the water, so that it washes much more easily than any other kind. Have ready two pans of hot water (but not sufficiently hot to be uncomfortable to the hands, say 90 deg., Eahr.). In one pan dissolve as much soap jelly as will make a good lather, take each flannel singly and immerse it in the lather, wash it all over quickly, giving the collar and cuffs an extra rub. Well rinse in the second pan of hot water as quickly as pos- sible and put it through a wringer twice. If no machine is available, wring and roll tightly in a dust sheet; take out and shake well, stretching the neck and wrist- bands while drying. One tablet of SUNLIGHT SOAP will clean a dozen flannels; if new they will take double the quantity. When washing bright coloured flannels great care must be taken. Wash them m the manner described for white or grey, but to each gallon of water add a wineglass of common vinegar; this will preserve the colour till worn out When nearly dry press carefully with a hot iron I nave washed flannels that have been in wear for three years by this process, and have found it both satisfac- tory and economical. SUNLIGHT SOAP will make it so."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 214 Scientific A Wonderful Tunnel. On May 22nd, 1897, was opened, by the Prince of "Wales, the spacious tunnel under the Thames at Blackwall, which is the greatest undertaking of the kind executed by compressed air. The tunnel was cut only five or six feet below the bed of the river, the soil being of a loose, wet and gravelly nature. And the reason why the great river did not burst through and swamp out the busy workers was that a constant supply of compressed air was pumped into the large chamber in which the work of excavation proceeded. The ordinary air presses upon our bodies at the rate of about 14 lbs. to the square inch, but it is so equable and so constant that we are quite used to it and we do not feel it; but the pressure of air in the chamber was raised to about 40 lbs. to the square inch, and this pressure, with the great " shield " that was erected, enabled the men to delve out the soil in safety. The cost of this splendid tunnel, which is 6,200 feet long, including the open approaches, was, in round figures, about li millions of pounds sterling. The tunnel is lit by electricity, and forms not only a means of crossing under the Thames—without payment—to myriads of busy workers on both sides—for there is a large industrial neighbourhood on both shores—but also affords a means of conveying vegetables and fruit across the river from the rural districts of Kent and Essex. Electric Traction. Electrical Traction, i.e., hauling cars along by electricity, has made marked progress, and a new electric underground railway, from Waterloo Station, to the City, has been opened in London, (1897), while- several others are now m process of construction in different parts of the great metropolis. The City and South London was the first of these lines, and was opened a few years ago; the electricity being conveyed from the dynamo at a fixed station by a third rail running between the rails for the wheels. The electricity is taken from the third (conducting) rail by means of a "shoe, oi? " Just a line to tell you SUNUGIlFsOAP215 SCIENTIFIC. copper brush, which glides along the rail as the train proceeds. For underground lines, where no persons are likely to stray on to the rails, this system is no doubt suitable and valuable; but for street or road tramways it would not be safe. The electricity on the conducting rail would be so strong as to be dangerous like a flash of lightning. What is called, therefore, the overhead system, is frequently adopted. In this method the conducting line runs on high standards, like telegraph poles and lines, and a rod projecting from the car presses lightly with a small wheel against the line and "takes off" the electricity to the motor on the car as it passes along. There are noW many tramway lines in Europe worked by electricity, and substantially, all are on this sj^stem. In the United States there are some thousands of miles of electrically worked tramway lines. Electricity can be stored in accumulators and carried in the car without any conducting lines or rails, but the accumulators are heavy. When the electricity can be obtained cheaply the cost of electric traction is less than that of horse-power. "Chaining Niagara." This leads us to notice the great development going on in the use of waterfalls and heads of water for the production of electric power. The greatest instance of this is the utilisation of Niagara Falls, the works at which have steadily proceeded. l)uring 1897 electric current obtained at Niagara Falls was sent to Buffalo—some twenty-six miles distant— for purposes of lighting, for the telephone, and for supplying power to work machinery. The electricity is sent on lines raised on poles, placed 100 feet apart, the land on which the poles are fixed being carefully fenced. The poles carry three cross pieces, these pieces bearing the wires for conducting the electricity. Several new water wheels and electricity gene- rators have also been placed by the Falls and quite an array of factories is growing up in the neighbourhood to take advantage of the cheap electric power being supplied. It may be stated briefly that the power is obtained by turning off some of the water above the Falls into an artificial channel which in its fall and flow drives a number of turbines or water wheels, which operate the electricity producers. Scientific men in different parts of the world have been deans clothes and almost anything else,2l6 "SUNLIGHT" YEAK-BUUK. turning their attention to the similar use of water power to generate electricity. In Great Britain the most celebrated instance is at the Falls of Foyers, in Inverness-shire, where the manufacture of chlorate of potash and acetylene gas (a new illuminant) is being carried on by means of electric power. In the United States water power is being used for the production of electricity in probably more than 300 places. "With a serviceable electric motor and a means of cheaply producing the electric current, it is most likely that we shall see an extended use of electricity for all kinds of things. Thus the electric dynamo and motor have been applied to ploughing, and to driving a threshing machine, and also to running fire-engines. The acetylene—the new illuminant spoken of just now— which has been made during the year at the Falls of Foyers "Works—is prepared from carbide of calcium. The carbide in fact yields this gas when put into water, and thus can be distributed easily in the solid form. The gas is said to be cheap and very powerful in its power of illumination. But when mixed with air it is apt to become very explosive. AsTBONOMY. In astronomy, the total eclipse of the sun on August 9 th, 1896, proved almost a total failure, though an English party ;0f observation in Sir G. Baden Powell's yacht at Nova Zembla obtained some success. A long streamer or appendage was seen stretching out from the sun on the north-east corner estimated to be 750,000 miles, while another extended m the north-west for some 500,000 miles. Mars was in a favourable position for scrutiny in the winter though his observers had to be up early in the morning. The great work of photo- graphing the heavens h.as progressed steadily.

Chemistry. The comparative failure of the Solar eclipse prevented any further knowledge being added to the chemistry of the Sun, but chemists have been busy with the new " elements," argon and helium. It now seems established that these are elementary bodies—that is, not compounds of other elements—but yet " they possess no chemical affinity, and do not enter into combination." Late in the year 1896 the Davy-Faraday Eesearch Labora- tory of the Eoyal Institution was opened, it having been completed under an endowmeO by Dr. Mond. Lord Eayleigh and Professor Dewar.are the cmeciGrs, and the superinten- dent, Dr. Scott, M.A. Speaking generally, manufacturers are coming to realise that knowledge of chemistry as applied to arts and manufactures is increasingly, nay, vitally important, and the subject of chemical education has been discussed by Sir Henry Eoscoe -and Dr. Gladstone. In Germany there are splendid laboratories which have a very marked influence on technical industries ; hitherto we, in Great Britain, have been somewhat indifferent to this sort of thing, and we have, for instance, permitted the aniline dye industry, which was discovered in Britain by Dr. W. H. Perkin, to slip somewhat out of our hands into German fingers; but there are signs that we are awaking to these facts, as witness Dr. Gladstone's Eeport on Science Teaching in Elementary Schools. Medicine. In Medicine, the " jubilee" of aneesthetics occurred in September, 1896, it having been on September 80th, 1846, that ether was first used for obviating pain in a surgical operation. Sir Joseph Lister (now Lord Lister), at the British Association meeting, expressed the opinion that chloroform carefully given was more safe than ether. Doctors have also been recommending the use of " incubators " for prematurely born infants. These incubators, such as Aurard s may be simply boxes, kept uniformly warm by Dottles ot hot water, or a hot water tank, damp sponges being washed with SUNLIGHT SOAP.ai8 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. used to prevent the air from becoming too dry; Hearson's " thermostatic nurse " is, however, provided with an automatic contrivance which cuts off the heat when the apparatus is in danger of becoming too hot. Mention must also be made of the Home for Epileptics at Chalfont St. Peter. Mr. Passmore Edwards gave a farm for the purpose, and late in 1895 the branch for men, the first of its kind, was opened; since then the branch for women and children has been actively pushed forward. The epileptics are employed in suitable and useful avocations, with the view of mitigating their terrible complaint. The further observation of the serum therapy of diphtheria has increased faith in the treatment, andYirchow, comparing statistics of the Children's Hospital, showed that when the serum therapy was used, the deaths were about two-thirds fewer in number, i.e., percentage of deaths was reduced from 37-63 to 11-2. The Lancet has also discovered that the plan of preparing cocoa with alkali of 'some kind is on the increase. The reason is, it is said, to make the cocoa more soluble, but the cocoa "fat" is partially saponified and makes the beverage look fuller-bodied and deeper in colour. It is said that the use of alkali does not make the cocoa more tasty and digestible, and that in fact the alkali tends to cause indigestion. The use of cocoas quito free from alkali would appear to be desirable. The use of permanganate of potash for opium poisoning has been shown to be very efficacious, and picric acid has been introduced as an excellent remedy for burns and scalds. The value of vaccination as a preventive for smallpox has been keenly liscussed, and the centenary of Jenner has been celebrated. Undoubtedly, however, the application of the famous "X" or Eontgen Pays to both medical and surgical science has been one of the most remarkable and important of facts. This new "light" has been used to detect foreign matters in the body, and needles and bullets in the human frame have been thus discovered, also the course of broken bones and dislocations have been traced. It is said they will also kill the germs or bacteria of that fell complaint diphtheria. The full effect and application of this new power, which will reveal hidden things, are not yet perhaps fully understood, but the increasing use of the rays has been a marked feature in the science of the time. Take life easy, use SUNLIGHT SOAP.THE CINEMATOGRAPH. 2ig THE CINEMATOGRAPH, OR LIVING PICTURES. This ingenious and pleasing exhibition has become very popular. The method of working it, though at first sight almost incomprehensible, yet becomes fairly clear on exami- nation. Most persons are familiar with the toy known as the Zoe trope, or wheel of life, in which several pictures of a figure in different positions are presented to the eye as one moving figure; the Cinematograph is in essence a variation and an enlargement of this idea. The Zoetrope is a hollow cylinder something like a very large cup, with straight sides, containing a number of pictures inside, showing, for instance, a boy jumping over a brook, each picture showing his successive movements in the act of jumping; the upper part of the side of the cylinder is pierced with slits, and as the instrument is set revolving, on a pivot fixed to the bottom, the figures appear to blend into one—but moving—as the beholder looks through the slits, which also appear to1 blend. The result is that you appear to see the boy actually move over the brook in the act of jumping. The set of pictures can of course be removed from the instrument and another set inserted. Edison improved this toy by substitu- ting photographs for pictures and called the instrument the Kinetoscope, and then Monsieur Lumiere, of Lyons, enlarged 1 the idea by throwing the photographs of the Kinetoscope on a screen by an optical lantern. The instantaneous photographs of say the successive movements of a horse race are thus thrown on the screen so quickly that they blend before the eyesight, and thus produce the effect of a living picture. In fact one photograph has not left the eyesight before the next in succession flashes after it. Hence the term Living Picture. A French gentleman named Cordy is said to have taken a set of photographs of growing flowers at different stages of development, and flashing them thus quickly on the screen, shows you a plant growing and budding and flowering in a moment or so. This living picture, though no doubt interesting, must, however, be likely to have an unnatural effect, for in nature we do not see plants budding and flowering in a minute; but scenes like boat races, an animated street, and so on, seem to produce better results, SUNLIGHT SOAP, largest sale in the world.220 « SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK.

PHRENOLOGY. Phrenology is said to have received its name from Forster in 1815, it having been previously called " craniology," &c. The word phrenology comes from the Greek, and means words or discourses on the mind. It was founded by Dr. F. J. Gall, a Viennese doctor (1758—1828), and extended by Spurzheim—who was Gall's associate and pupil—by George and Andrew Combe, Dr. Elliotson, and others. It may be said to be based on the ideas that there is a close connection between brain and mind; that mental powers can 1?T be divided into independent faculties; that these faculties can be referred to a definite seat or locality in the brain and that the size of these localities indicates the power ot the faThee8sys.tem here followed is that of Spurzheim and Combe, and has been the most used in Great Britain. Uut Dhvsiology and anatomy show that the exterior of the brain is not a reliable or correct index to character or mind; and manv eminent scientific men have strongly opposed the system. On the other hand, there does appear to be some evidence in favour of some of the generalizations and of some localization of faculties.

Modern English works are largely based on two French writers, D'Arpentigny and Desbarrolles: While it is quite possible that the form and features of the hand may yield indications as to character and temperament, we need hardly warn our readers against placing implicit confidence in the foretelling of events from the hand. The fingers are named (beginning at .the forefinger):— Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, and Mercury. The fleshy pads at the base of each are termed "Mounts," and are named after the fingers below which they occur. The "ball" (or third phalange of the thumb) is called the Mount of Yenus. In the centre of the palm is the plain or triangle of Mars. Below the Mount of Mercury is the Mount of Mars ; extending from the last mount / /s^ up to the wrist is the &A Mount of Luna, or the Moon. 1. ..The upper %n\ phalange of the thumb indicates will and de- cision of character. 2.

The effect of these "Mounts," however, may be much modified by the lines of the hand. There are four principal lines and several others of minor importance. 6. Line of Saturn, or of Fate, is not present in all hands, but, if long and clear-cut, indicates happiness and prosperity; if broken or winding, indicates misfortunes or difficulties. _ 7. Line of Heart, if long and clear-cut, denotes affection and devotion. 8. Line of Health, or of Liver, if well marked, indicates health and long life. 9. Line of Mars, if strongly marked, denotes a martial and warlike disposition. 10. The Line of Life, surrounding the thumb, and, L£ long, supposed to indicate long life. The Bracelets of Life, or the Eascette. Each bracelet is supposed to represent thirty years of life, and when well marked, emphasise the effect of the "Line of Life," denoting length of life and happiness, especially if they should rise to the hand. The Line of Apollo, or Brilliancy (below the Mount of Apollo) if well marked, indicates success in art. This line is not present in all hands. The Girdle of Venus indicates a bad character on the whole, and a character liable to be influenced by love; it is not seen on all hands. Via Lasciva, also called "The Milky "Way," is not always seen, and denotes faithlessness and cunning. It is near the line of health, for which it is sometimes mistaken. The division of the fingers by joints are called phalanges. The first indicate intuition, or intuitive faculties; the second reasoning powers; and the third material instincts. The middle of the hand is the quadrangle, and if broad and open, indicates generosity ; if narrow, avarice.426 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. PRECIOUS STONES. Many fine stones have been fonnd in South. Africa, but some of them are tinted yellow or brown. The Star of South Africa, or the Dudley diamond (the property of the Countess of Dudley) is, however, of stainless purity. After cutting, it weighs 46£ carats, value about £20,000. The celebrated Porter Ehodes diamond is a "blue-white" weighing 150 carats, and valued at £60,000. In 1888 a yellowish stone was found as big as a hen's egg, weighing 428£ carats; but in 1895 a still larger diamond was reported from the Transvaal, valued at £634,000 and weighing 634 carats. The Star of the South diamond, found in a river in Minas Geraes, Brazil, by a negress in 1853, weighed 254£ carats. When cut its weight was 125 carats, and it was sold to the Gaekwar of Baroda for £80,000. Diamonds should be colourless, but should yield brilliant flashes of light. Chemically they are carbon. M.

Some Famous Diamonds of the Woeld. The " Kohinoe, " is one of the most famous of diamonds. The name signifies "Mountain of Light." Tradition carries its history back to legendary times, and after many romantic adventures it passed to Eunjit Singh, and on his death was kept in the Treasury of Lahore; when the Punjab was annexed by Britain (1849), it was stipulated that this diamond should be pre- sented to Queen Victoria. It was re-cut and the weight reduced from 186 & to 106,^6 carats. A carat for weighing precious stones is equal to 3^6 grains troy. The '' Orloff '' was found in India, where it was said to have formed the eye of an idol in Mysore, and to have been stolen by a Frenchman, and purchased in 1776, in Amster- dam, by Prince Orloff—hence the name —for Catherine II. of Russia. It is now in the sceptre of the Czar of Russia, and weighs 193 carats. Impossible to state the price, but it has been valued at not less than £100,000. The " Regent " was found at Parteal Mines, India 1701, and was sold to an English captain. Thomas Pitt, who was Governor of Fort St. George (his grand- son was first Earl of Chatham), bought it, and afterwards sold it to the Regent of France (1717), for £135,000. It is now pre- served in thb State jewels of France, and has been valued at nearly half a million pounds. After being re-cut itf3 weight is about 136 carats.

RANGE OF VISION AT DIFFERENT HEIGHT5. Distances You Can See. Were the earth flat and there were no obstructions, the • range of vision would be much larger than now; but the rotundity of the earth considerably limits the distance of sight. Thus, a man on the sea, with his eyes, say, six feet above the water level, would only be able to see a distance of some 3 J miles, because of the sloping away of the earth's rotundity. For this reason, also, great heights appear low at a distance, until, as we say, they sink below the horizon. At 10 ft. high a per3on may be able to see nearly H miles before the slope of the earth prevents him from seeing further. At 20 ft. high, nearly 6 miles. At 25 ft. high, nearly 6f miles. At 40 ft. high, something over 8J miles-. At 100 ft. high, nearly 13£ miles. At 200 ft. high, nearly 18J miles. At 500 ft. high, something over 29£ miles. At 1,000 ft. nearly 42 miles. At 5,000 ft., 93£ miles. It will be seen that the range of vision does not increase in proportion the higher you ascend, but becomes slightly less each foot you rise. Thus the distance you can see at 10 ft. high is about 4J miles, but at 20 ft. high it is barely six miles. SUNLIGHT SOAP does its workHOW LONG PLANTS WILL LIVE. 2ag HOW LONG MAN AND ANIMALS LIVE.

These are again divided into the hardy—such as the Rocket larkspur, candytuft, nemophila ; the half-hardy, which need protection and artificial heat in their early stages, such as the China aster, phlox drummondi, marigold; and the tender annuals which should be cultivated in a greenhouse, such as the melon and the cockscomb, &c. Biennials are plants which flower and bear fruit only in their second year and then die. They do not flower in their quickly, thoroughly and well.230 "SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. first year. The foxglove is a biennial, so also is the wall- flower, stock, carrots, turnips, parsnips, &c. Biennials may become annuals if sown early and forced to develop their flowers, while if seeding be prevented, some may last longer than two years. Perennials.—Plants which continue for serial years, and which exhibit a great variation of longevity. British Oaks— Said to attain an age of over 1,000 years. The " King Oak," in Windsor Forest, is said to have afforded shelter to William the Conqueror. An oak at Cowthorpe, near Knaresboro', measured 48 feet round the trunk, three feet above the ground, a few years ago. Larches attain an age of 200 years. Bate Palms, said to live between 200 and 300 years. Yews live between 300 and 400 years, and some much longer. A yew, in the churchyard of Darley Dale, Derby- shire, is said to be 3,000 years old; it is over 33 feet in circumference. The Sequoia, or Giant Tree of California, estimated to attain an age of from 2,000 to 3,000 years, estimates being based on the number of the concentric rings m the trunk. The girth of one of these trees that fell was 40 ft. The Common Olive.—Plantations at Terni, Italy, believed to have existed since the days of Pliny, 1880-1900 years ago.

" An Englishman's House is his Castle," is the Englishman's boast, and he believes that he is as secure nowadays within the four brick walls of his cottage as his ancestors were behind their moats, and dykes, and drawbridges. What will he Bay, then, to hear that such a belief is but a miserable delusion, and that so far from being as safe a3 a castle, his house can be entered at any moment by an intruder who waits neither for leave, welcome, nor permission to stay : an intruder who can disable his body, waste his time, take his work from him, rob him of the savings of years, and can even take from him for ever the treasures that are still dearer to him than any money, while he is forced to stand by power- less ? How can any house accessible to so terrible a presence be compared to a castle ? There may be people who will deny that any intruder exists who can thus devastate our homes against our will. Alas ! Truth is stranger than fiction. This picture of the enemy who lurks within the shadow of our homeB, and whose course is marked with woe, is drawn in colours all too faint, this enemy's name is INFECTION. In view, then, of the fact that this unseen and terrible foe is always waiting to force an entrance within our doors, can any- thing be more important to learn than how this foe may be kept out? r Science teaches us that there are a number of diseases which ought not to exist at all, and which will not exist when we take the trouble to learn how their propagation can be prevented. LOSS OF WORK. How many houses have been broken up, how many women and children have been driven into the workhouse by this cause, who can calculate ? To what extent our present death and disease rates are capable of being lowered we oan judge best by looking for a moment at the statistics of the prisons of our country.SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Edinburgh, 1890. ** For years back," says Dr. George Wilson, " the prisons of this country have been proved by the most rigid statistics to be far healthier than our homes, and so-called preventable disease of any kind is so rare within their walls, that when isolated cases do appear they at once give rise to surprise and are sure to call for enquiry." Why should this be ? Why should our prisons be so much healthier than our homes ? Why should the death rate in the free cottage be 20 per cent, and the sick rate nearly 100 per cent, higher than in the captive's cell? Because, in the prisons of to-day the great scientific fact is recognized, that all infectious diseases are propagated by living seeds or germs, and therefore means are taken to prevent their propagation. The practical question for us all then is, " How shall we pre- vent infectious diseases from entering our homes ? " The answer is, " By destroying the seeds of infection." « But how can this be done as the seed is invisible ? " The answer to this is fortunately simple. 1. By boiling. 2. By burning. 3. By using LIFEBUOY SOAP. Thorough boiling or burning will destroy every kind of disease germs, but we cannot obviously always employ such means. We cannot boil our hands or bodies, on which the germs may lurk unseen if we have been near sick people. If we are not rich we cannot burn everything in the room where measles or whooping cough is nursed. " What are we to do then ? " Why, we can destroy it in another way wnicu is simple, cheap, and sure — "By the use of Lifebuoy Soap." How will this do it ? " Because this SOAP is so strongly impregnated with a potent disinfectant (i.e., killer of infection) that its use will ensure the utter destruction of all germs of disease, which, because unseen, are often unsuspected until they have produced their deadly fruit. v™.^ Where there are dirty boards, filthy sinks, musty cupboards, foul smells, there disease is surely germinating and will thrive. One bar of LIFEBUOY SOAP will stop this deadly work It will not only remove the seeds of sickness which thrive in dirt, but it will destroy them. If merely removedthey wiU undoubtedly spring up somewhere else, but once LI FEBUOY SOAP has been applied, all lurking disease germs, not only those o i infectious disease, but the germs of putrefaction which pro- duce Sres and skin diseases, mould and decay, are killed, and therefore can never again produce disease.ARCHITECTURAL. 235 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Jamaica, 1891, Hrcbitectural EVENTS OF 1896-7. Public interest in architectural events is usually very local in its character. It rarely finds much to concern it in any serious consideration of architectural progress in general. And yet it should be a matter of considerable importance to the public, seeing how much good architecture has to do with good health and the enhancement of the aesthetic quality of our streets and their architecture. One of the questions closely affecting the public in regard to architecture is the education of the architect. For some time past now the Eoyal Institute of British Architects, which is the representative society of the English "profession, has undertaken the work of an examining body, and has instituted preliminary, intermediate, and final examinations held periodically in London and certain provincial centres. This three-fold system has only lately come into regular operation, and, judging by the numbers availing themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of testing their theoretical and practical knowledge, the scheme may be said to have thoroughly answered the expectations of its founders. In 1896 no fewer than 165 candidates passed the preliminary examination, and were registered as probationers; 68 pro- bationers passed the intermediate examination and were registered as students ; whilst, of the 76 candidates examined in the final, 35 passed. There are now some 872 pro- bationers, and 798 students on the respective registers. In May, 1896, the Architectural Association celebrated the jubilee of its foundation. This association has always been particularly identified with the important question of archi- tectural education. Originally by evening classes, and latterly by the establishment of a curriculum, and the insti- tution of a largely extended teaching system, the Association has accomplished a great deal for the benefit of architectural students, and the promotion of an efficient standard of profes- sional education. One question of importance affecting the relationship of architects to the public is contained in a Bill introduced year236 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Ottawa, 1893. by year into Parliament for the compulsory registration of architects after the fashion of the medical and legal profes- sions. Hitherto it has met with scant chance of passing into law, and certain conferences held in various parts of the country, in 1896, under the auspices of its promoters, were unproductive of any new arguments in favour of the Bill. The Bill is strongly opposed by the Boyal Institute of British Architects, and other professional bodies. The death of Mr. George Gilbert Scott, F.S.A., the eldest son of the late Sir George Gilbert Scott, the eminent architect, on the 6th of May, 1897, removed from our midst an ecclesias- tical architect of the very first rank. Indeed nothing finer in the way of modern church design is to be found in England, than Mr. Scott's, church at Norwich, for the Duke of Norfolk. He had retired from actual practice some three or four years before his death. The death of Lord Leighton, the gifted President of the Boyal Academy, was an event which concerned architecture, in that he was an Hon. Pellow of the Boyal Institute of British Architects, and had received the Institute's highest honour, viz.:— the Boyal Gold Medal. Several of his latest addresses to the Eoyal Academy students dealt particularly with certain periods of continental architecture. Then the death of Mr. W. H. White, for eighteen years the able and energetic secretary of the Institute of British Architects, was a distinct loss to the profession no less than to the Institute. Mr. William Morris, too, who has also passed over to the majority, was more or less intimately associated with the decorative arts appertaining to architecture. A notable addition to the public buildings of -London is the British Art Gallery, built on the old MiUbank Prison site. It is to house the splendid collection of modern pictures by British artists given to the nation by Mr. Henry Tate. The cost of the buildings, which have been designed by Mr. Sidney E. J. Smith, F.E.I.B.A., will be something like £100,000, and the value of the pictures is set down at something like £75,000. One of the most important building projects of 1897 is that of the proposed new Government Offices, in Whitehall, which has formed the subject of consideration by a Special Parliamentary Com- mittee. The question of site has proved a debatablejme,237 ARCHITECTURAL, SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Kimberley, 1892. and the settlement of this and the obtaining of a suitable (or unsuitable) design will not be likely to admit of any actual commencement of the work till 1898, if indeed then. The South Kensington Museum Buildings completion scheme, which was the subject of a competition amongst a selected few of our best-known architects, and resulted m the selection of a design by Messrs. Aston "Webb and Ingress Bell, still hangs fire. It has been proposed that the work should be undertaken as a memorial of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, but no such commemoration can rid us of the national disgrace of having left them so long unfinished. Three important municipal public buildings were opened during the period covered by our notes. The first inaugura- ted were those at Bath, designed by Mr. J. M. Brydon, of London. The next were the Oxford Buildings, designed by Mr. H. T. Hare (London), and opened by the Prince of Wales. The third on the list were the Sheffield Municipal Buildings, designed by Mr. E. W. Mountford (London), and opened by Her Majesty the Queen. Edinburgh has had a munificent gift offered in the shape of a public hall, which is to cost its donor something like £100,000. Manchester, Edinburgh, and Newcastle-on-Tyne all have large building schemes on the way in connection with their respective infirmaries. Canterbury, Salisbury, and Peterborough Cathedrals have been in the hands of the restorers (or destroyers as some would have us call them) during the past eighteen months or so. Work on the West Front of Peterborough Cathedral was not commenced without much strong and indignant remon- strance from the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and other anti-restorers. "Whatever may be said for or against the course adopted at Peterborough by the architect, Mr. J. L. Pearson, R.A., and approved by the Dean and Chapter, there is no doubt at all but that architectural vandalism is still a power for mischief which has to be reckoned with. Artisans' dwellings schemes have been largely projected by Manchester, Saliord, Liverpool and other provincial cities, whilst the London County Council have also dabbled con- siderably in this kind of building speculation. The London County Council attempted to get a scheme"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 238 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Ghent, 1889. passed by Parliament for the erection of a grand Connty Hall in Trafalgar Square. But neither the site nor the estimated cost of the scheme commended themselves to the House of Commons majority, and the scheme was rejected. The proposed new thoroughfare from Holborn to the Strand, with its contingent architectural possibilities, also remained a paper scheme. The houses which have so long blocked up one of the best exterior views of Westminster Abbey have been removed— except Mr. Labouchere's—and now the public are able to properly view—and appreciate if they can—the exterior of the Chapter House and the flank of Henry VII. 's Chapel. The buildings for the Paris Exhibition of 1900 formed the subject of an important competition amongst French archi- tects in 1896. Some 60 designs were actually sent in, and in the result the work was divided up amongst the authors of the designs placed 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th respectively, whilst the general oversight of the whole work was placed in the hands of M. GirauLt. A competition for a foreign building of international im- portance, in which English architects took part, was that for the new Museum of Egyptian Antiquities. The work fell, however, to a Prench architect, M. Dourgnon, and the founda- tion stone of the new structure was laid in the spring of 1897. A notable addition to the already large number of huge hotels in London has been the Hotel Cecil, whilst one of the most recent, and in point of general convenience and comfort, about the best addition to London theatres has been Her Majesty's, in the Haymarket, built for Mr. Eeerbohm Tree, from designs by Mr. Phipps, P.S.A. But of the archi- tectural qualities of these buildings the less said the better. The question of the best way of commemorating the Queen's long reign in some permanent form in London called forth a variety of suggestions, all more or less of a utilitarian character. But the hospital project seems to have put most other ideas of a national memorial into the shade. Still, the suggestion of an architectural journal that we might have an artistic memorial of the Queen and her reign, purely as a work of art, in architecture and sculpture, and as a monu- ment only, without considering its practical use, was an excellent one that might well have bean carried out.ENGLISH ARCHITECTURE. 239 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Lyons, 1894. ENGLISH ARCHITECTURE. Historically, the study of English architecture carries ua back to the invasion of Britain by the Romans ; practically, we need go no farther back than the Norman Conquest. There certainly had been some attempt made towards the close of the Anglo-Saxon era to build churches, but these were rude structures, mostly constructed of wood, and laid out on the lines of contemporary Roman art. Traces of this Saxon, or early round-arched style, have been discovered in some 35 or 40 churches, and one particularly notable instance is the Saxon doorway under the tower of Monkwearmouth Church, in Durham, in which the characteristics of the style are' specially evidenced. But the art was certainly of the rudest type, though the style was nevertheless distinctly arcuated* The Saxon style lasted 366 years. It was, however, the Norman Conquest which ushered in the first real epoch of architectural history in this country. What the Saxons had done in the way of ecclesiastical art waa destroyed to make way for a rebuilding on a finer and more ex- tensive scale altogether. "With an astonishing appreciation for the true principles of architectural proportion ("the> fundamental element of the beautiful in architecture ") the architects of the Norman period upreared cathedrals and churches which by their form and size had at least the one great quality of impressiveness. Good examples of Norman work are to be noted in St. Bartholomew's Church, Smith- field, London, and Durham and Ely Cathedrals. The latter, of course, furnish us with two of the best typical specimens. But the architecture of this period of the round-arched style progressed rapidly in the direction of new methods of con- struction and the new application of carved work; whilst even painting became an allied art in a practical sense. The Norman period lasted about 100 years. In 1185 there began the rise of Gothic art, which on account of its " lancet ''-shaped windows was called the Lancet style,known also as Pointed, architecture. No doubt there was a transitional stage, but scarcely sufficient to form a recognised period of art. The Lancet style (or Plantagenet, as Eergusson terms it) progressed for some 60 or 100 years, developing thereafter into the "Early" and "Late"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 240 SUNLIGHT SOAP Decorated " periods. These latter brought Gothic architec- ture up to that point of richness and ornamentation which formed the culmination of its beauty. It then passed into what is termed the "Perpendicular" stage, which was the final phase of Gothic art, divisible into two stages—Early and Late. The Late stage was the final end of Gothic. It was at this stage that Henry YII.'s Chapel, Westminster, and King's College Chapel at Cambridge was built. Of this final ending Fergusson writes :—" Under the Tudors the style went out in a blaze of glory. Nothing can be mor, gorgeous or fascinating than the Boyal chapels and other contemporary fan-roofed buildings; but they are like the fabled dying hues of the dolphin—bright and brilliant, but unnatural and fleeting. It was the last spasmodic effort of an expiring style, and soon passed away." Then followed the Eenaissanee, which in a large sense was a reversion to precedents and in accordance with the in- tellectual movement of the times. Eoman forms were again employed, though by no means without originality of adapta- tion. But though the Gothic style was practically dead, yet it still made itself apparent even in Eenaissanee work, and here and there were to be noted Eenaissanee buildings which showed a distinctly general Gothic effect and feeling. Since the Eenaissanee, English architects have had a re- vival of both Greek and Gothic styles, and their latest move is in the direction of a resuscitation of Eenaissanee. English architecture, in the understanding of architects, may be roughly traced as follows :—Beginning with Saxon work, we trace its progress through Norman, Early English Gothic, Decorated, and Perpendicular Gothic to Tudor, Jacobean, and Queen Anne; after which there began a series of revivals from a very severe Classic type to a very energetic, and for the most part, ill-digested revival of Gothic art through various phases of neo-Classic and Eenaissanee, back to Quoen Anne architecture again. This is, roughly speaking, a summary of the course of English architecture till, in the present day, we have no settled style at all, except that, in a general way, churches are still built in the Gothic style (chiefly, at present, following the later periods), whilst for public and private buildings of various sorts, various forma of Eenaissanee art are generally adopted. The very latest,ENGLISH ARCHITECTURE. 241 and perhaps we might say the cleverest, efforts in modern architectural art in England savour very much of affectation, and are often of a very archaic type of art. To briefly sum up the position of English architecture to- day we should perhaps be within the mark in saying that our best architects produce country houses such as cannot be equalled anywhere in the world for picturesque beauty and simplicity allied with all the comfort and practical conveni- ences which modern ingenuity and science have rendered possible; whilst in regard to modern Gothic churches, we think it would be impossible for any nation in the world to vie with a few of the foremost English architects in the production of characteristic, refined and beautiful Gothic churches. But un- fortunately, one cannot feel that such efforts are directed in the best manner, because the conditions of worship, which called forth our great Gothic churches, are now so different to the time when the English laboured under the stern rule of priests and soldiers. It is in the design of public buildings of any important nature that English architects fall far short of the possibilities of their art, and compared with them, both Erench and American architects of the first rank are far superior. The elements of grandeur and scale seem to be beyond the grasp of nearly all our architects of any grade whatever. On the other hand, interesting detail and pictur- esque treatment are to be found in abundance, and there are in England buildings to which we may point with some con- siderable satisfaction as evidence of the progress we have made. Picturesqueness has always been a very essential quality of English architecture, and our great cathedrals will hold their own the world over from the impressiveness of their length, solidity ^ of treatment, and picturesqueness of features, in con- tra-distinction to French or German cathedrals, wherein great height and often extreme elegance of detail are the prevail- ing characteristics. It must be admitted that much of the beauty in our old churches is due to the offect of time and tone, and often to the variations of style in which we now see them. The one great striking example we have of a complete Gothic church in one style, the Cathedral of Salisbury, is undoubtedly monotonous to a degree. Some of the most charm- makes linen whiter and homes brighter.242 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP ing results in our English churches are where the massive Norman work is in keen contrast to the elegance and richness of the Perpendicular style. Few English cathedrals are fully satisfactory in their entire effect, either as to exterior or interior, and they are, as a rule, especially deficient in the design of their western frontages. Foreign cathedrals, on the other hand, are in general very highly distinguished by this portion of their designs. The towers and spires and lanterns are, how- ever, features which often seem to atone for defects in other parts of the English churches. The spires of Norwich, Salis- bury, and Lichfield, and the towers of York, Durham, Peter- borough, Worcester, and Gloucester are features by which we distinguish and remember the churches to which they belong. It is difficult to imagine a more striking or pleasing architectural composition than a great church like that of Durham, piled up with its three towers high above the river bed, or the Cathe- dral of Worcester, with its central tower and immense length of roof running east and west, flanked by pinnacles, and the whole dominating the city above the river bank. The most interesting cathedrals in England are York, Winchester, Lincoln, Hereford, Norwich, Canterbury, Wells, and Exeter. One striking exception to the great mass of Gothic cathe- drals is St. Paul's Cathedral, which was built by Sir Christopher Wren in Eoman Classic. It has been at once immensely admired and considerably abused. One cannot deny it certain elements of dignity and beauty. The dome, with its peristyle, is very pleasingly proportioned, and the general mass of the building is grouped up finely. Perhaps the interior may be considered the most generally satisfactory part; it certainly conveys an idea of its great size to the mmd in a way which the bigger church of St. Peter's at Eome quite fails to do. In the exterior design of the building there are two very notable shams. The height of the walls is very much above the level of the roof, and the big exterior dome is constructed at a very considerable height above the interior dome. A great defect in the design of the building is that it is divided into two stories of equal height. On the whole, however, the building is one of the finest metropolitan cathe' drals in the world. „ , . ... It is not, after all, in the architecture of churches or publicENGLISH ARCHITECTURE. 243 buildings that the interest of the public is most keenly touched. It is in our homes that we can realise most clearly the advantages of good architecture. Country homes and town houses of the most picturesque charm have been built in our time by R. Norman Shaw, W. Eden Nesfield, Philip Webb, J. D. Sedding, Ernest George & Peto, Douglas & Ford- ham, Ernest Newton, E. S. Prior, E. J". May, Mervyn Macart- ney, and others. Such homes as these it would not be possi- ble to surpass in the whole world for combined beauty and comfort. To the general public they are practically unknown, certainly as regards their interiors, but they form a most important item in counting up the quality of modern English architecture. Our beautiful old English homes are more widely known, but it is on a careful study of these that the designs of our best modern homes have been based. As the building of houses touches most nearly the personal interest of us all, it is in the architecture of private dwellings that we should be most appreciative of progress and develop- ment. Fortunately, for us in England, domestic architecture is the strong point of English architects, though their efforts in this direction are too often nullified by the architectural degeneracy of the times, and lack of discriminative apprecia- tion on the part of the public. And it is not alone in the homes of the wealthy, but also in cottages that we find evidence of genuine improvement, both from an artistic and. sanitary point of view. It is greatly to be desired that so practical an art as that of architecture should be brought home more closely to the appreciation of all, both rich and poor. Doubtless the really best architectural results in house interiors are practically unknown to the bulk of English people, for even if they had the discernment to appreciate these qualities they have little or no opportunity of seeing them. It is not at all necessarily m the mansions of the wealthy that we find evidence of first-rate architectural talent, for many noted big houses are both vulgarly ostentatious and characterless in design, li the public realised how much artistic charm and cosiness might be imparted to the simplest homes, at little or nothing beyond the ordinary cost, they would surely make the small eflort needful to secure brighter and pleasanter homes. The makes light work of a heavy wash.» SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK, 244 SUNLIGHT SOAP usual dull and awkward type of terrace houses is not by any means a necessity, and in one or two instances the way has been shown by capitalists—on a somewhat limited scale of course—how to produce good architecture and pleasant, com- fovtable homes for the working classes by the employment of clever architects. This has been notably the case at Port Sunlight, where Messrs. Lever Brothers, Limited, have built a whole village for their workpeople on lines as far removed from the ordinary type of artisans' dwellings—even the so-called "improved" dwellings—as Windsor Castle is from 1,002, Deadly-dull Terrace. By enlisting the services of really clever architects they have secured a result at once charm- ingly picturesque from an architectural point of view, and thoroughly satisfactory from the practical standpoints of health and comfort. The illustrations and description which appear elsewhere in the present volume will give our readers a good idea of this unique attempt to build a model village on really architectural lines. Speaking generally, it would appear as if English people had become so affected by the degenerating influences which have been at work ever since our long history of national architecture came to an end with the Jacobean and Queen Anne work, that they are now content with the most nonde- script rubbish. Time was when English architecture had some architectural quality about it. Now it is either more or less a successful revival of some dead style or a quite name- less concoction of characterless features. People have too often arrived at the conclusion that an architect is an expensive luxury that can very weU be dispensed with, and the result is, that speculative builders' architecture forms the bulk of our modern domestic work, ana is ail done with the most absolute disregard for art. let notwithstanding aU these discouraging influences we could point to many cases in which most dehghtf ul homes have been produced, and often enough for people whose means are very limited. This fact, perhaps more than any other, &™J* hope for the future of English architecture. For although we may lament the lack of a national style, we may at least rejoice that the love of art and of architecture is more. culti- vated in the homes and minds of the people to-day than it has ever been before. .STYLES OF ARCHITECTURE. 245 makes homes brighter and hearts lighter." SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. 246 SUNLIGHT SOAP is made in a twin bar We give some examples of architectural styles, which illustrate fundamental principles. The Egyptian columns show the two varieties the one a plain circular column, ornamented with hieroglyphics and having a vase-shaped cap; the other being like nothing so much as a bundle of rods tied together at intervals with a series of band-like hoops round a barrel. The Corinthian column is the pure Grecian type (from the Choragio monument of Lysicratee). The Doric column is from the Parthenon at Athens, and represents the order in its severest and purest form. The Ionio column i3 an Athenian example; some Athenian examples have a neck below the echinus (or quarter- round moulding), decorated with flowers and plants. We only give the original Grecian types of the Classic orders, for the Roman was only a variation therefrom. Our other illustrations represent a Norman column, and the several types of Gothic piers, columns, and caps.STRENGTH OF TIMBER AND CAST IRON. 24? THE COMPARATIVE STRENGTH OF TIMBER AND CAST IRON. Ik regard to Cast Iron, experiments by eminent engineers Lave shown the average ultimate strength of the usual kinds of cast-iron to be:—Torsion (or pulling), 6 tons per square inch of section; shearing, 8£ tons; transverse (or bending) 13£ tons; and compression (or thrusting), 38 tons. Torsion, or twisting, stress does not occur in buildings. The surface of cast iron is more compact, stronger and harder than the interior, and the larger the casting the greater is this difference, and consequently the smaller the pro- portionate average strength. Cast iron is very slightly elastic. It does not rust so rapidly in moist air as either wrought iron or steel, and the thicker the casting, the slower the rate of corrosion. Cast iron offers great resistance to compression, and is specially suitable for those portions of structures bearing only steady compressive strains. Timber is considerably affected by age and moisture, and practical testing is of even more importance for timber than in the case of cast iron, as the variations of strength are greater in apparently similar samples. It has also to be borne in mind that dry timber is more than double the strength of wet. The resistance of timber to crushing across the fibres is less than in the direction of their length, whilst of resistance to shearing exactly the opposite is the case. Birch, Dantzic fir, pitch pine, mahogany, poplar, sycamore, willow, and American oak offer resistance to crushing in the direction of the fibres varying from 1 to 3 tons per square inch, or much less than one-twelfth that of cast iron. English oak, ash, elm, teak, beech, and hornbeam show a resistance of from 3 to 4 tons. It may be calculated that the strength of a piece of timber, fixed at both ends, and loaded in the middle, is to that of a like piece only supported at both ends and loaded in the middle as 3 to 2.

State oe Employment. Not only was there a decided improvement in the general employment of labour in the spring of 1897—as is often the ca8e_trat the percentage of unemployed, according to trade unions making returns, was less than at any period since tttf autumn of 1890. . There were 114 trzle unions which made returns, having an aggregate membership of 453,963 ; of these 2-5 per cent, or 11,169, were reported as unemployed at the end of March, 1897, comparing with 3-5 percent, in 108 unions having a membership of 415,731, making returns in March, lbJb. Further, the percentage of unemployed in February, itsy/, from the 114 unions mentioned above, was 3 per cent. These figures all testify to the welcome improvement id employment which set in, in the earlier part of the year. Moreover, this improvement was spread over many indus- tries-in coal-mining, in the Pg-^.^^^JP^S furnaces and rolling mills, smpbuildmg, the building and furnishing trades, printing and bookbinding, bodi "id^e, ready-male trades, and several others. Employment however, was slack in the ^^.^^^SSg? trade, dull in the woollen and moderate m the ^^«a^?J while' the cotton trade showed some ™V™™?^J££$£ and at the riverside in London, employment was also better Lnt the slme period in 1896 ; the figures being accor^ng to the Labour Gazette, 14,596, average ^"^^^ employed daily in March, 1897, at the docks and wharves; 14,762 in February, and 13 343 m Marct, l«»o. Lastly, on this head, agricultura employment wasge^aUy satisfactory throughout the country ^.^'^i^e there was some irregularity because of wet weather m earlier part of that month. Strikes. It may be news to many people that there have beerL a greainumb^r_o£^om^COMMERCIAL, 251 for the sake of effectiveness. month alone, February, 1897, there were 77, involving 24,231 workpeople, and in March, 96 new ones, iavolving 29,582 workpeople. These figures may be compared with 95 strikes, involving about 22,000 workpeople, which took place in March, 1896. The great strikes are well reported in the leading newspapers all over the country, and attract universal attention; but there appear to be nearly always several smaller disputes, of varying magnitude, proceeding in different industries, and ending with varying success. Particulars of the results of some of these strikes may be interesting and instructive. Thus in one month, that of March, 1897, no fewer than 96 old and new disputes were settled, involving 18,375 workpeople. Thirty-two of these disputes, involving 4,036 individuals, were successful from the workpeople's point of view; 36, involving 6,631 indivi* duals, were unsuccessful; and 28, involving 7,708 individuals, ended in a compromise. It is calculated that 470,000 working days were lost in March, 220,000 in February, and 310,000 in January, owing to new and old labour disputes, or 1,000,000 working days for the first quarter of the year 1897, giving, as an estimated average for the whole year, and bearing in mind that the returns are not all before us, 4,000,000 working days lost, owing to labour disputes. The disputes occurred in a number of various industries^ including the building trades, mining and quarrying, textile, clothing, dock labour, tin-plate, iron and steel manufacture, engineering and shipbuilding trades, coal mining, &c. The causes were very various, some of the disputes being for advance of wages, and some against the employment of non- unionists, &c. Such frequent disputes and losses give great importance to all attempts at conciliation and arbitration, and a number of cases have been settled, and agreements made by the operation of such boards. To give a few interesting and instructive instances:— A protracted strike of spinners took place at Slaithwaite, lasting from June, 1896, to March, 1897. The workers were employed by the Slaithwaite Spinning Company, and the strike involved some 75 spinners, and threw out of work a number of other hands. It was caused by the directors refusing to pay for certain " extras "; the directors also declined to deal with252 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. the men's union, and notices were posted excluding unionists from employment. At length, on December 7th, 1896 an appli- cation was made to the Board of Trade on behalf of the men to take action under the Conciliation Act, and a representative went down to Slaithwaite, and finally, after interviews with both sides, was invited to be present at a meeting between the directors and the men's representatives, Eventually it was decided that certain payments should be made for extras, and the notice confining employment to non-unionists was removed, and about the end of March the men agreed to resume work as vacancies permitted—some places having been previously filled. This was a case under the Act, but cases have teen settled by other Boards. There is, for instance the North-East Marine Engineers' Conciliation Board. This Board held a meeting on°March 19th, 1897, to consider the question. 0£ wages, and came to the decision of an increase of ten shJl ngs a month, with proportionate daily and weekly rates. Other cases could be quoted. The Conciliation Act, 1896.

Over 4,000 workpeople suffered decreases, these being in the mining and quarrying industries, and also in weav- ing, dyeing, &c, in a certain town. Hours of employment have also been shortened in some cases. Thus, from May 1st the hours of the bricklayers of Wolverhampton and district were reduced from 50J to 48 in a full week, exclusive of overtime. Again, from the same date, the hours of the carpenters and joiners of Eochdale, for a full week, exclusive of overtime, were reduced from 43^ to 41. The North Wales Quarry Dispute. One of the most notable events was the unhappy dispute between Lord Penrhyn and the quarrymen and others engaged at his slate quarries, Bethesda, North Wales. During the whole of October, 1896, this dispute was in progress, and lasted for months afterwards. The causes, which are somewhat complicated, may thus be summarised :—For some time dissatisfaction had been expressed by the men regarding certain of their conditions of employment. Much of the work was conducted on the bargain system; thus the quarrying was let for a month at a time in certain parts of the quarry to a "crew" of usually three "partners," who sometimes employed a "journeyman." The bargain price varied according to the advantages or difficulties of getting the slate in the particular part of the quarry taken, the variations in the bargain price being thought to meet these differences of advantage or disadvantage. Further, the basis of the bargains was a price list adopted some years ago, greater or lesser additions being made to the list, and known as pound- age. Now, one cause of dissatisfaction arose with regard to the a Eybelwyr," or workers who did not come into this bargain system, as, for instance, men who were not capable of taking work on that system, or for whom a "bargain" could not be found, and boys who were learning the work. There were, it is said, 278 men and 260 boys in the Eybelwyr. tT° fTn desired a dimi™tion of these numbers, and that they should come into the bargain system; also that apprentices should receive a poundage of ten shillings.254 " SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. At length, on September 25th, Lord Penrhyn gave a definite reply to the demands. He refused the rise in the standard rate and the claim for a minimum wage ; promised to admit no more boys to the quarry until further notice, and thus, by degrees,reduce the number of theRybelwyr; and be would also consider the subject of poundage for apprentices. Toward the end of September-the 26th-two workmen were dismissed. Their presence had been demanded at the office nearly a fortnight before, but on the advice ox the committee, they had declined to attend, and had been sus- pended from work. At a mass meeting, therefore the men Wved to strike a few months ahead unless their more E^t dainui were conceded, and a resolf ion was also tmssed that it was their duty to call the attention ot the Crd of TradeWto the matter and ask for their mtervention under the Conciliation Act of 1898. „ ,., Two days afterwards-September 28th-all of the Quarry Committee, in fact 71 men altogether were b™]^*™ their work: thereupon the men met and passed a resolution dSSi that they also should cease work until an ezpllnSwas forthcoming from the ^gemen Correspondence passed between Sir Courtenay Boyle of the Board of Trade, and Lord Penrhyn, and in a letter da ted at issue, the Board ot xiaae mttuo workmen, a friendly conference between yourselt and yonxj* > dispute obtained employment ehewhere,jh.others^ supported by a relief fund Wile, now ,M in of Trade, under the Conciliation Act>/f? and Settling this dispute,it^-^"^Si,. must be regarded as a useful piece of l^ooui & Condition of Tbade.—Its Ketivai.. _ The revival of trade in the TJnW Kingdom, beg* SUNLIGHT SOAP suppliesCOMMERCIAL. 255 the largest demand in the world. House of Commons, and through that Hous6 to the Empire at large on April 29th, 1897. He said,—"Twelve months ago it was my duty to call the attention of the Committee to the financial condition of the country. I had to place before them the record of a very prosperous year. The credit of the country had never stood so high, the revenue had never been so large, the expenditure never so immense, and we had never specifically devoted so much to the reduction of the National Debt. Financially we seemed to be on the crest of a wave, and it would have been rash to have anticipated that we should rise even higher. And yet we have done so. In spite of political circumstances in the United States, which for a time paralysed trade, in spite of unrest in South Africa, distress in India, and anxieties in the East of Europe, the revival of trade, which commenced in the summer of 1895, has been well maintained." Value of British Foreign Trade. "The total value of our foreign trade in 1895 was £702,500,000. The total value of our foreign trade in 1896 was £738,000,000, an increase of five per cent., to some extent m prices, but mainly in volume. I think I may say that our home trade is not less flourishing. The returns of the earnings of our railway companies, the smaller list of failures, the increased returns of our bankers' clearing-houses, especially in the provinces, and our labour statistics showing better employment in the skilled labour market, and last, but by no means least, the ray of hope given to the most depressed agricultural districts by a good wheat crop and higher prices for it, all, I think, tend to increase the prosperitv of the country." r J Revenue of the United Kingdom. " During- tHe last year our people Have smoked and drunk f1019' rri 7 haVe earned more money and paid more income tax. They have written more letters, and last but not least, they have paid more death duties than in the preceding year -Lherefore, I hope I may be allowed this deduction, that the country is not going backwards." This maybe called an official bird's-eye view of the com- mercial and financial condition of the country, and as such it is given here.256 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. WHAT WE OBTAIN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

GREAT FINANCIAL CRISES. "Law's Bubble."—John Law, a Scotsman, who was born in Edinburgh in 1681, drafted a scheme for founding a bank in France, the profits of which were to pay off the French national debt. The establishment was opened in 1716, and two years later it was declared a royal bank; the shares rose enormously high, but in 1720 came a collapse, and ruin spread throughout the land. South Sea Bubble.—The company was started in 1710, and was badly, and afterwards dishonestly, managed. Thousands of families were rained. Failures in England.—In February, 1826, a Parliamen- tary Return showed that in the four preceding months 79 banks and banking establishments had failed; and following this, numbers of merchants and manufacturers became bankrupt. United States banks stop cash payments, 1839. _ Severe panic in France; 93 companies fail for six millions, 1839 Great commercial panic in England; failures to the amount of 20 millions ; discount, 8 and even 13 per cent., October, 184/.

This picture shows in a striking manner how much more a working-man can buy with his money in Britain than abroad. It will be seen that the purchasing power of money earned by the working classes in Great Britain is much more than in any of these countries. That is, you can get more for your money in Britain, or again—to put it in another way—things are cheaper. Thus, if a working-man pays a halfpenny for°a herring m England he would have to pay fd. or Id. for it m New York. Still less will the same money buy in Trance; still less again, in Germany; less in Belgium, and nrrm less in Russia.

Many a road of poor nouses and many a dull window may be brightened by gay blossoms, for some people seem to have the faculty of making flowers thrive in the most unlikely places. And why?

In bther words they require care and attention and an'interest m their welfare, for those who take such interest will soon discover the conditions which suit them < best. Eemember always to keep - your garden neat; i.e., remove dead leaves, also grass, from paths, and trim any lawn grass frequently. Observe the effect of what you do, and profit by your observations. January. — Alterations in flower garden should now be made, and beds may be prepared for ranunculuses and anemones. In open weather roses may be planted, but manure should be placed on them after planting. Evergreens should not be moved this month, nor is it a good time for pruning fruit trees, still, if the pruning be in arrears, it may be conducted in mild weather. Daisies, winter aconite, Christmas rose, common hepatica, are among the plants in bloom. Cuttings of gooseberry and currant trees may now be planted though it is late. If the weather be mild and dry, peas, beans, "two-bladed" onions, cabbage, carrots, and parsnips may he sown, though such early sowing is risky.

Among flowers in bloom are snowdrops, spring meadow saffron, cycla- men, and candytuft. The kitchen - garden should be well prepared, dug up and manured, so that the manure should be incor- porated with the soil. Potatoes may be planted on dry soils, and peas, spinach, beans, leeks, parsnips may be sown in open places; while radishes, hardy lettuces, parsley and cabbage on warm slopes.

Hardy annuals and perennials may be sown early. Plant dahlia roots; divide old chrysanthemum roots and plant out perennials. Forget-me-not, narcissi, daffodils, violas, auriculas, wall-flowers, primroses, violets, pansies, &c, are all in flower. Protect wall trees from severe east winds; yet permit them to have plenty of air. "Water fruit-trees in pots abundantly, and in the kitchen-garden complete sowings as early as possible. Celery, beet, cabbages, cauliflowers, lettuces, onions, &c, should all be sown. May.—Sowings of all annuals to succeed in flower those sown earlier, may now be made. Tender annuals, such as asters and zinnias, may now be sown; also half-hardy and hardy perennials. Do not forget to water chrysanthemums, hollyhocks, and roses. Eoots of polyanthuses and primroses that have finished blooming may be parted and re-planted. Picotees and carnations may be trained to sticks. Water strawberries freely. Numbers of flowers, among them auriculas, lilies of the valley, &c, should be in bloom this month. "Weeds should be kept out of kitchen and flower garden; give growing vege- tables plenty of water and liquid manure; trench celery, sow peas and beans, mar- rows, cabbages and broccoli, &c, if you want a succession to those sown earlier.

Do not, however, drench young plants too much at a time, or chilly evening winds may check them. Cucumbers, tomatoes, capsicum, &c, may now be planted out. Give asparagus beds a pound of salt to a square yard of surface, and water with liquid manure from horse dung. July. — Plant out cuttings of all kinds, and bedding plants may also be put out.

Remember a strawberry bed does not "pay" after three years; prepare, therefore, a new plantation and trench up the old bed for winter crops after its third year. As the crops of vegetables are reaped dig over the ground. Plant out Brussels sprouts, savoys, cabbages, &c.; sow seed of winter spinach, and sow last crops of French beans, lettuce, endive, &c. Asparagus beds still require plenty of liquid manure. As great heat may be experienced in July, the mowings of grass may be spread ovei the grass as a pre- ventive against crack- ing of the earth. August.—Bedding plants may now be "struck" from cut- tings ; plant the young shoots of fuch- sias, verbenas, and petunias.

Water chrysanthemums well, and stake them if necessary. Asters and autumn crocuses are now in bloom. Work for fruit next season should be com- menced, such as new plantations of bush fruit-trees, goose- berries, currants and raspberries. These trees may be care- fully removed without harm at the end of this month; but they should be planted in deeply trenched and well-manured ground. The roots of unfruitful and thick growing trees may be pruned. Eipe seeds of plants may be gathered and dried. Potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and beets may be dug up, and August-sown cabbage planted out; kitchen garden ground should be tidied for the winter and trenched over for next year. Ehubarb may be planted also for production next season. Asparagus stems should be cut and the crowns may be covered with a little manure and a little fresh soil on the top of it. Toward the end of the month or whenever sign of frost appears, plants too tender to bear the frost should be placed under cover as soon as possible. Leaves should be swept up and buried to make leaf mould. November.—Auriculas, pansies, choice carnations, &c, and plants that cannot stand the winter, and that were not housed toward the end of last month, should speedily be placed under cover. Dahlia bulbs should be taken up and placed beyond reach of frost, heat, or wet. J j not planted last month for spring flowering, must now be speedily got into the ground. Eoses for next sea- son may be planted in good, loamy soil. Any seeds of plants that remain may be gathered and dried indoors. Fruit-trees may be pruned and Wanted in fair weather. Pruning requires great care, but is Peepetual Rose.277 HORTICULTURE, off healthy bearing trees. Some authorities recommend that the pieces cut off should be burned, and the ashes strewn over the ground about the trees, after it has been dug up. Every branch which chokes up the centre should be cut away. Cut back to good joints. Ground should be dug well over • the exposure of the soil to the weather does much good. As a rule it is well not to manure ground in the autumn because heavy rain washes it away. December.—If the cold be severe, plants, such as pansies, pinks and tulips may be protected by ashes or straw litter. Fuchsias, that will bear the treatment, may be cut down, and their roots covered with ashes. Also protect tender fruit-trees f rom cold winds by boards or canvas coverings. Fruit-trees that do not grow too luxuriantly may be well manured; a layer of dung, say half a foot thick, may beplaced about the stem to a dis- tance of perhaps three feet. For gooseberry and currant trees the manure may be lightly forked in to mix it with the soil. In the case of rasp- berries, however, the manure should not be forked in but laid on the soil. Rhubarb, asparagus and horseradish plantations may now be made. Eotting leaves, manures, &c, may be turned over occasionally. Roots of trees that grow verv luxuriantly may be pruned.

The great points are to chooseyour^ variety of birds to suit the place where you intend tXep then?; and to see that they are cleanly kept, comfortably housed and suitably fed. If fowls have to be kept in confinement, a breed like Lang- No wear and tearTHE KEEPING OF POULTRY, the Langshans especially make good table birds. Hamburga are splendid layers, but like a good run. Pure Dorkings are fine table birds, and altogether form a fine breed of fowls. They do not lay well in the winter, however, and the chickens are delicate. One great secret, morever, of success in small runs is to keep young birds only—not later than their third year, and perhaps, indeed, only one year after they begin to lay. Creve-Cceurs yield large, well-fleshed chickens, giving a good quantity of meat, white in colour. Cochixs. Another secret is not to keep too many birds for the space —about 16 square feet of floor in the house to every six fowls, being about the necessary dimensions ; and yet another point is to supply the birds regularly with those things which they would obtain for themselves if permitted a free run. Eegular feeding is most important; green food, and also a moderate amount of flesh food (if they cannot procure worms, grubs and slugs for themselves which tend to increase production of eggs) should form portions of their dietary, also broken oyster shells or lime, and smaU gravel and grit. Plenty of ^eshj^ater should be placed within theirreach. The green ^c^UNLIGHlTsOAP is used.280 "SUNLIGHT'1 YEAR-BOOK. food may be freshly-cut grass, or lettuce or cabbage leaves. Other points to be noted are : Hatch out chickens early, and also arrange hatchings so that pullets will come on to lay at Christmas-time when eggs are perhaps most valuable. The House should be as spacious as possible, warm and dry, yet well-ventilated. Warmth is an important factor in causing hens to lay eggs. Cold and wet are most pernicious to them. The house should be sheltered from the north and east and if possible face the south. It should also be fre- quently cleaned ; the droppings of poultry make good manure. An inner door of wire netting may be made so that during the day the boarded door may be open and light and air and sunshine admitted to the house. The roosting perches should not be placed too high. Particular attention must be paid to the roof to see that it is watertight and the floor dry. The Run should also be kept scrupulously clean, and with this purpose, should be frequently dug oyer and the surface soil sometimes renewed. Part of it may be covered so that the fowls have a shelter in case of rain. Under the shelter also mav be placed their sand or dust bath, and a few heaps of ashes or coarse sand in which they dust themselves and so cleanse their skin and feathers. Sitting Hens and the Raising of Chickens.—If possible endeavour to procure a few sittings of eggs early m Febru- ary or early in March. Chickens so reared will, of course, require much care, but you will reap a reward in getting early birds If you cannot possibly procure a broody hen so early you may try an incubator. Some poultry breeders are using incubators to a remarkable degree, and any firm supplying one S send full directions for its use On the other hand it is saTd by some authorities that a hen may be induced to sit at any time by placing her in a comparatively small covered basket in a dark room, keeping her warm and feed- ing her on food such as bread soaked in ^"^f UP fresh meat, raw liver, or a warm mash of oatmeal potatoes and milk, 'in selecting eggs for sitting ^7 Bhould not be more than a fortnight old, but should in fact be as fiesk as Tssible Furtherf they should be all about the same fresh- ness so that they will hatch out about the same fame Eemember, that the older the egg the weaker as a rule will be the chicken. When SUNLIGHT SOAP is usedTHE KEEPING OF POULTRY, 281 Cochin hens delight in sitting, and Mr. Hugh Piper declares that the best and cheapest plan of maintaining a good stock of poultry is to keep one or two full-feathered "Cochins for March or April sittings. A Cochin, moreover, should lay through the winter, as will also Brahmas and Hamburgs up to their second and third year. Pullets, i.e., young Lens, hatched out in March or April, and which will have got over their moulting early (hens do not lay when ■moulting), should begin to lay eggs by November, and continue to lay until February or March, when they may be killed for the table, another suc- cession of fowls taking their place, or they may be kept till the autumn, Beahma, •and then kiUed. It is the management of fowls, so as to obtain a constant succession of fresh young birds and esSB which makes them pay.

The nests should be placed m a secluded spot, and, if possible, apart from the poultry house and run. The nest should not be too dry, that is, it may be on a brick or earthen floor. "We have always found, says Mr. Tegetmeier, "that the eggs hatch much better if the nests Pencilled Hamburg. are made bv placing a cut turf and a shovel of mould, sand, or aSes, iX bo/or basket, and on this a little short straw ?n this way a convenient hollow nest is obtaW that events the eejrs rolling out from under the sitting hen. in SSd^ftiSfegg- afe thus kept of a nmjh nio*.equable temperature than in nests made simply of loose stiaw- „ «Why we recomm^nd_grmmd_nests^ A friend in need is a friend indeed—THE KEEPING OF POULTRY, 283 says another authority, " is, that it is admitted that the hen that steals a nest in a hedge generally hatches all her eggs, and brings home strong chickens; whereas the one that sits at home in a dry box or basket often spoils many of her eggs, and her chickens are frequently weakly, which we attribute to the great evaporation that takes place from the egg during incubation in such unnaturally dry nests, which DOEKING. also renders the chicken feverish and weakly." If the season is very dry the eggs may be sprinkled with tepid water when the hen is off the nest. The nest should not be very deep and should be only so large that the bird can just fill it Further, the inside should be as nearly flat as possible so that the eggs may not lean or knock together. ftp?re?P«im? 76 1th6 nest once a da?' t0 feed* t0 8tretch gieirlegaajittte, to have their dust bath, and to maintain ^NLIGH^SOA^a friend in need.284 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. their health; sometimes hens must he enticed away by a little tempting food. Barley, also barley meal and mashed potatoes may be given when they leave the nest; but water and food may be kept near the nest. The fact is, a sitting hen should have as much food as she can eat; but to be fed continually on the nest tends to cripple hens. The bird should not stay away more than half an hour at the longest, and when likely to remain away too long should be driven gently back, but not be caught. If necessary to remove the hen from the nest she should be carefully lifted off, by holding her under her wings. Thus, should she be sitting in the fowl-house, she can be removed, and fed, and then shut in again, without annoyance from the other fowls. About twenty-one days after the eggs were placed under the hen, the chickens should begin to break the shells. Ihe time may be a few hours earlier if the eggs were very fresh; and a few hours later if the eggs were stale. Much as you might like to assist the little creatures m breaking their shells, you should not, as a rule, attempt to do so; though some chickens may be stuck to the sheU and require help, it, in about six hours' time, the sheU is not broken. < The chick is very tender, and the operation requires the greatest care. The hole in the shell may be enlarged with a Icissor's point, but the utmost delicacy is necessary The chicks willnot require food for about twenty-four hours after hatching. The first meal should consist of bread- crumbs steeped in milk, and the yolk of egg boiled hard; or good egg custard. Then, at intervals of about two hoiiis coafse oatmeal, slightly moistened with milk, or water so as to be crumbly, may be given for a few days, but you must be careful that the milk is not sour or does not become so afterwards crushed wheat, or oats may be thrown down and a mixture of oatmeal and Indian meal given the growing chicks Thev also require green food, and if they have no grass platon which \o run, lettuces and cabbie leaves chopped up, and grass, also cut into small pieces, may be give?them; a little cooked meat, finely minced, may like- wise be added to their daily dietary.

Fat is added to fowls by penning them in a coop (though, if well fed from the first, they hardly need this process). A tray, filled with dry and fresh earth, should be placed on the floor, and be renewed every day to keep the coop wholesome. The best food for fattening is said to be buckwheat meal; barley meal and oatmeal are both good also, especially if mixed with milk, while green food must also be given. Feeding-.—Dr. EC. B. Greene in " Poultry " declares that "a bird will thrive better if a different kind of grain is given each day than if four or five varieties of grain are combined and given daily." Fowls kept in enclosed yards should be fed with three meals q day. The first may consist of soft food, barley meal or oat* meal, mixed with pollard or bran, boiled potatoes or minced potato peelings and kitchen scraps. This should be given warm Langshan Hen.

Barley is a good flesh-forming food, as also is wheat; but oats and oatmeal are more flesh-forming, and also contain more fat-making substance than wheat. Barley, however, is cheaper, by weight. Oatmeal, in fact, is too dear for general use. Dari and buckwheat are also recommended. Peas and beans are a very flesh-forming food, but are not suitable for continuous use. Potatoes should not, as a rule, be given alone; they are too starchy; mixed with meal or bran they form a good food for the morning. Potato peelings may be used in this way,—they may be boiled until soft, and then mashed up with scalded bran to make a dryish paste. Experience will soon indicate the best methods of feeding fowls, especially if the effect of foods upon them be watched. The role is to avoid both over- feeding and under-feeding. " Give them," says Mr. Lewis Wright, "as much as they will eat eagerly, and no more; directly they begin to feed with apparent indifference, or cease to run when the food is thrown to a little distance, the supply should be stopped Food should never be left on the ground. If such a slovenly practice be permitted, much of what is eaten will be wasted, and a great deal will never be eaten at all, for fowls are dainty in their ways, and unless at starvation point, always refuse sour or sodden food." Be particular that the drinking water is always clean and fresh; dirty water makes the fowls ill. As a rule, if fowls do become ill it is better to kill them at once to prevent the risk of infection. Eoup is caused hy cold and wet and is very contagious ; it begins like a cold, and a bad discharge takes place from the nostril. Separate the bird from the others ; add a little sulphate of iron and a little sulphuric acid to its drinking water and wash the fowl's head with tepid water. It should be fed on meal, and Mr. Lewis Wright recommends half a grain of cayenne pepper and half a grain of powdered allspice in a sort of pill of the meal. If a fowl have the "gapes" it is said that a little spirits of turpentine with the grain thrown to the birds is good. To preserve Egg's new=laid for Months.

They need not be packed in any special way, but kept as most convenient, but it is best to keep the small end up. Glycerine answers much better than butter or grease for this purpose, as it will never turn rancid as these do, and thereby spoil the flavour of the egg. It is important to use Lever's Glycerine for this purpose as it is guaranteed to be absolutely pure. THE REARING OF CATTLE.

Thus, for instance, two-year-old heifers may be bought in April, put to grass and allowed to graze during summer and autumn, and may be housed early in November. Cows should not be moved when they are yielding full milk—say about tho beginning of summer—as the supply of milk is affected by difference in pasture or in water, ! The farmer should also decide whether he requires milk for ■sale, or milk for making butter and cheese ; different breeds being suitable for different purposes. There are for instance, among many others, the Sussex, the Norfolk or fruttoik, the Devon (generally a dun-coloured red), the SUNLIGHT SOAP—an absolutely pure soap."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 288 Alderney, the Kerry, the Hereford, and the Scotch Highland breed. Speaking generally, the well-known " Shorthorn *' breed are the most numerous and the most impor- tant of all, and are great favourites; they are good Devon Steer milkers, apt to fatten well, and quiet-tempered. The West Highland, as the name implies, prevails in the North-west of Scotland; these cattle will gain flesh where the Shorthorn could scarcely live. But though their milk is rich, it is scanty, and the cows would hardly suit a dairy farmer, unless for poor pasture and cold climate, where other cattle would not thrive. These cattle produce splendid beef. Eereforda and Devons again, are good for meat; but not, perhaps, so good everywhere for dairy purposes. It is said the Devon© will produce more meat than any other breed on the same food. Some maintain, however, that Herefords, in their native county, are as good as Shorthorns. Ayrshire cattle are exceedingly good milkers, even on poor food, but they are not so suitable for raising for the butcher. It is said that a cross between a Shorthorn bull and an Ayrshire cow is an excellent animal. The KerryJs, perhaps, the best breed, and some think the only aboriginal, of Irish cows ; small m size and good as milkers, and also good for getting into excel- lent condition for the butcher. They are excellent for small farms, and will do well even when tethered on a small piece of grass. The Alderney yields a very rich quality of milk, and the creamproduces excellent butter; the quantity, however, is comparatively small. Alderneys include both Jersey and Guernsey cattle, the Jerseys being "butter cows and are Bometimeskept in dairy farms to give good colour to milk and "^UNUGHT SOAP, Highest Award, Chicago, 1893.THE REARING OF CATTLE. 289 butter. Families keeping a cow for the milk could not prob- ably do better than the Alderney or Guernsey breed. These cows may be kept tethered, and in the Channel Islands it is said children tend them. Sussex are something like Devons, from whom they have no doubt descended. They are red in colour, and were wont to be used as draught oxen, and also for beef ; but lately more attention has been paid to their milk-producing properties. The Norfolk Red-polled are something like the Sussex, and are red in colour, but have " knobs" instead of horns on their heads. Greater attention has lately been paid to the obtaining of milk from Norfolk and Suffolk cattle. The Longhoms as a class are now dying out. The horns of the breed often grew to a length of 30 inches^ and turned downwards and inwards, so that some- Fai Hereford Heifer. times the cattle could not eat short grass: The Shorthorns appear to have largely driven them out of fashion. Thus it will be seen that there are breeds having a tendency to pro- duce meat for the butcher rather than milk, and also different kinds of milk producers. f/ielthe ^ » it ^ould be left with the mother WhirlTi a iartmPht> and sllould get the cow's milk, r^virria? arTent *uaKty- Two °^arts of milk twice jjgy^jjjyto_b^enough food for the first week.

After the first week the calf may be fed on skimmed milk, the farmer having the cream for butter making. Then a substitute for milk may be tried. Some authorities mention hay tea and Unseed jelly. Scotch Highland Beeed. Pour boiling water over some fine sweet hay and cover the vessel and let it stand for two hours, when a strong liquor will be found in the pan; linseed jelly is made by boiling a quart of linseed in six quarts of water for ten minutes^dd to it the " hay tea," and give the mixture to the calf ai the same warmth as that of natural milk. Skimmed milk must be added if the linseed jelly is not. The proportion is one-fourth more of the "hay tea" than milk, afterwards increasing to double as much. Skimmed milk thickened with oatmeal or linseed, or linseed and ground wheat mixed, is good food for calves The milk should be boiled and given the natural warmth of cow's milk. To teach the calf to drink from a pail, wet a finger in the milk and hold it to the calf in the pail. Feed regularly and three times a day. After about a month the calf will begin to eat a little hay, and a fortnight later it will take crushed oil-cake, sliced roots, or meal. From the first, feed regularly and well, and observe how steadily the calf arrives at and maintains good condition. Young calves of course must be kept in a warm shed, and one cow may be given two calves. Eemember that from the moment of birth the calf should be kept growing and improving until it arrives at maturity; otherwise it will not pay. When weaned the milk should not be taken from it too suddenly. It may beTHE REARING OF CATTLE. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Jamaiea, 1891.La given milk in the middle of the day, for seven or ten days after being turned into a grass field. As to the age of selling cattle for food, Shorthorn steers fetch good prices between two and three years of age, while it is questionable if double as much is realised for those from four to five years of age. When a cow has had three, or may be five, calves, she may be milked until the yield begins to decrease. If well fed it will be found that she becomes more fleshy as the milk diminishes, and if three on four pounds of oil-cake be added to the ordinary food daily she should soon come into excellent con- dition and perhaps fetch, for butcher's meat, a thoroughly remunerative price—though, as everyone knows, market prices vary. A cow, in short, should not be kept for profit after the age of eight or nine years. Much depends on management of Leiceste^ Ewe. BtocJc and the willingness of the owner to profit by experience and be always ready to learn. Concerning feeding, straw of all kinds may perhaps be used much more than it has been—pea straw being probably the most nutritious. Straw and sliced turnips, as much as they can eat, form good winter food for stock. Feeding milch cows for milk varies very much in different places. Such cows go to grass in the summer, and have hay and mangold in the winter. A good cow so fed should yield, it is eaid, from 500 to 550 gallons of milk per annum. Distillers and brewers' grains are often given in towns, and pea meal mixed with the grains. Pea meal may be given to cows losing their milk. Speaking generally, roots form a large portion of the food given to cows in winter and spring, and it is said that a little crushed oats, or beans, or oil-cake will neutralize the taste of butter from turnip feeding. Cows should always have plenty of clean water.293 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Ottawa, 1893. Sheep.—The breeds of English sheep have been much im^ proved, and Leicesters, or, as they are sometimes termed, New Leicesters, are very famous. The mutton is of good quality, and may be fattened at an early age, while the sheep produce a satisfactory weight of flesh for a comparatively small quantity of food. Their wool is rather between the long wool and the short wool varieties, which are the two main divisions of sheep in Great Britain; but the Leicesters are generally classed with the long wool breeds, as are also the Komneys and the Cotswolds, among others; moreover, none of these are horned. Among the short wool varieties are the well- known Southdown, the Exmoor and Dartmoor, which are also horned, the Welsh Mountain, the Cheviot, &c. The Leicesters have risen to a very high esteem, probably because they are likely to be the most profitable. The Southdowns are also a celebrated race ; they take their name from the low range of hills of that name in Sussex and Hampshire. Feeding on the short grass of these downs the sheep are, to an extent, "mountain" sheep, yet they become fit for killing at from 15 months to two years of age. The Southdowns have, it is said, nearly superseded the Hamp- shire and the Berkshire breeds, and in fact, answer well all over the south. Ewes generally give birth to their lambs between their second and fifth years ; they should not have lambs after their fifth year ; but the successful breeding of sheep depends largely upon the pasture; and after lambing the point to be aimed at should be rapid and continuous pro- Southdown Ewe. gress. Turnips, grass, chaffed straw, and pea haulm form good food. Dry food, such as the latter, may be given with turnips to counteract their watery character; straw chaff may also be given with mangolds, which may then be used at all seasons. Small quantities of linseed cake, bran, or grain may be given to vary the roots, promote health and further fattening.THE REARING OF CATTLE, 393 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Kimberley, 1892. Pigs.—The Berkshire is perhaps the best breed of all the English varieties. The improved Berkshire is fine skinned and short boned, and has a smaller head and ears than the old Berkshire. There are, however, many crosses and varieties. The cross between the Berkshire and the Hamp- shire hog has produced a hardy and easily fattened animal that has proved very useful. Pigs may be profitably managed in several ways. They may be turned out to feed, but it must be remembered that if kept in the sty their manure accumulates, and is of great value. Sows are capable of bearing young pigs at nine months old, and can bear two litters a year. A fortnight after birth of the young the sow may be allowed to leave the sty, and when the little pigs are strong enough they may accom- pany her. About the age of tfer^e weeks is a good time, to kill sucking pigs, and the sow should not be allowed to suckle more than eight or nine little pigs. When weaned —that is, when six weeks or two months old—they should be fed with warm skim-milk and meal, and will soon learn to be independent, but may be permitted to take maternal milk twice a day at first, and then once a day. Now comes the feeding and fattening, and with a little care and attention, perhaps, no animal can be made more profitable. Barley meal made with water into a thin paste is the best food for fattening, but it is expensive. Grass, sow thistle, bad potatoes, hedge trimmings, nettles, weeds, grass mowings, and all kinds of things can be turned into the pigsty, but it is a mistake to give too much food at once, as the pigs tread it down into the dirt. To fatten pigs begin by giving a few boiled potatoes, in addition to their ordinary diet, and then lead on to barley meal; but pigs do not, as a rule, fatten well until they are from twelve to fifteen months. Acorns form exceedingly good food in the autumn, and the best time for turning out pigs is after harvest. Berkshire Pig."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 294 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Ghent, 1889. Iboueebolb* DOMESTIC ECONOMY. " I could feed half-a-dozen people on the things the So-and-So's waste," a careful housekeeper might exclaim, and allowing for a little pardonable exaggeration, there is no doubt but that the careful housekeeper will be right. Some people could live well, where others would almost starve. A little care, atten- tion and forethought are the great requirements to prevent waste, and make the most of things. In matters of ~ food, for instance, the, con- stant use of a good stock- pot no doubt saves much nourishment that would otherwise be thrown away {see Soups, etc., in " Cookery Eecipes"), while stale bread, too hard to eat, can be grated and kept for puddings, &c, by being kept closed in a wide-mouthed bottle. Again, to take another instance from another depart- ment of domestic life—when the bed-sheets begin to wear into holes in the middle, the sheet may be cut down the centre, and the two good outsides sewn together to make a new centre, the two ends which were the centre being hemmed to form the new outsides, and be tucked under the bed in the ordinary way. There are a thousand-and-one methods by which a caretul and thoughtful housewife may economise, without being stingy. The great point is, that she should regard it as her business in life to make the best of her home—es much her business as it is that of her husband's to pursue his avocation295 DOMESTIC ECONOMY. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Lyons, 1894. —and the battle is won. She will soon find out by experience What to do, and what to avoid. Now, the term Domestic Economy is a very large one. 3 really embraces food and cooking, clothing and washing, and the warming, ventilating, and cleaning of the dwelling. Several of these things are treated more fully under separate headings. Tinned Meat or Frozen Meat may be purchased instead cf fresh butcher's meat, but discrimination should be used. There is great difference in these foreign meats; some are undoubtedly very insipid, coarse and stringy; other brands again are tasty, juicy, and nourishing. Do not despise foreign meat because it is foreign ; with care in cooking—the great point being in frozen meat to see that it is thoroughly thawed before roasting—it forms an appetising and nourishing food. Butter.—When butter is very dear, good meat-dripping may be used in its stead. Good dripping, in fact, is much better than bad butter, and with a trifle of salt sprinkled over it when spread on the bread, most children will eat it gladly. It is very^useful as a heat-giver to the body, being, in fact, wholei^m^food. Cheese is, undoubtedly,good food; but the stomach cannot digest too much at a time, especially if the eater be not working in the open air. Hassell states that not more than one ounce should be eaten at a meal. It is said that cheese helps to digest other foods; if so, a small quantity will answer the purpose as well as a large one. Old cheese is not such good food as fairly new cheese, say six months old or so. When very new, cheese is indigestible. "We doubt if it should be eaten before it is six months old. Cheese varies much in price, but if it is over ninepence a pound, it is questionable if it can be called economical. Eggs aho are good food, but when boiled hard, the white is indigestible. They should be lightly cooked. Perhaps they are most digestible when beaten up in a cup of freshly- made good tea. Even a stale egg—not too stale, may be taken in this way. A cup of tea thus fortified is very good for persons in a weakly state of health, and may be taken with a slice or two of bread and butter. As to the economy" SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP 2g5 of eggs, the price varies so much that it is difficult to give a decided opinion; perhaps the best guide is this : they cease to be really economical when they cost over a penny each. Milk is one of the first of foods. We do not mean because it is food taken first by the young, but because it# is the^ most nutritious, and if purchasable at a reasonable price it is the cheapest food you can buy. In the Practical Dietary, Dr. Edward Smith states that a pint of new milk contains 546 grains of carbon and 43 grains of nitrogen; and a pint of skim milk—i.e., with the cream "skimmed" off for butter, 437 grains of carbon, and 43 grains of nitrogen. Thus the skim-milk, which is much cheaper than the new _ milk, is almost if not quite as valuable from a nourishing point of view as the new milk, and as Hassell says, the lo~i o; :rbaa may be made up by adding sugar. Hot milk, the late S.- Benjamin Ward Eichardson told the present writer, formed the best stimulant. It should not be boiled—but if a cup of milk be put into an oven or heated on a hob and taken in sips, it will stimulate and restore the jaded frame better than anything else. Once again we say, pure milk is the most nutritious of all foods ; and no true economy can be gained by cutting down a milk supply ; buy skim-milk and add sugar if you like, but a pennyworth of milk saved is not a penny gained. A stupid prejudice may prevail with some people against milk as an article of diet for adults, because it is the food of the young, but it is the merest prejudice. Chemical analysis shows that milk is as good for the adult as for the young ; the point is, of course, that the adult in good health requires his due amount of solid food as well. But do not be misled by the stupid remark that "Milk is food for babes as though it was food for no one else. The stalwart High- lander with his diet of milk and oat cakes puts that statement to shame. Milk, of course, can be used in a great variety of ways, in addition to simply adding it to tea or coffee. It can be thickened with flour and eggs, boiled with cocoa, and made with rice into pudding (aw "Cookery '),andm every guise it is thoroughly good food. In your household economy, therefore, give due place to milk, and rest assured that if you get it pure, and at a reasonable price, it is among the best and most economical of foods. Skim milk that is honestly sold as such, and not watered or adulterated m any297 DOMESTIC ECONOMY. way, is, of course, pure milk, and should be ve .ry economical, Bay at twopence a quart. Herrings and Haddock are among the most nutritious of fish. Indeed, it has been said that herring and potatoes form a perfect diet. Both dried herring and haddock also are more nutritious than salmon. It is a true instinct which leads many people to like a Yarmouth bloater. Herring, haddock and skate, especially the two former, are excellent and economical fish. New Bread should never be used. The careful housewife should resolutely refuse to allow a loaf to be cut until twenty- four hours after baking. New bread is indigestible, and it is also eaten much more freely without satisfying hunger ; it does not " go so far," as housekeepers say. Consequently, being indigestible, it injures health, and is practically more costly without producing adequate return. A good housewife, in ordering bread, or in baking it, will always, therefore, arrange to have a succession of loaves about twenty-four hours old coming into use. This arrangement; may seem trivial. It is really most important, both from a health-giving and purse-saving point of view. Nothing would seem to indicate the thoughtless and careless housekeeper more than the appearance of bread that is too new and cut to waste at one meal, and bread that is too stale at another. Wheat and Oats.—A very economical dinner. These are valuable foods. Good Scotch oatmeal is more flesh- forming than wheat, but somehow it does not seem to suit southern stomachs so well as wheat. Probably English cooks do not make oatmeal porridge so daintily as their fellow- countrywomen across the Tweed. There are various ways, however, in which oatmeal might be used with advantage • and if a person is really pressed for a meal, and the coppers are few in the pocket, one of the best things to do is to buy one or two pennyworth of coarse Scotch oatmeal, shake it gradually into boiling water {note, the water must boil as the oatmeal is shaken in), and keep it boiling for twenty minutes or so, and then eat the porridge with a half-penny- worth or pennyworth of skim milk and a little sugar. Good oat- meal porridge and milk might, at a pinch, form a meal for a tamily at very little cost; and if a herring, or even half a makes linen whiter and homes brighter.«' SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP herring apiece, with a potato, could be added, or could precede the porridge, the meal, in point of nourishment, would probably equal anything that could be bought; only, the cooking; must be good, so that the food is nice and tasty. Barley and Maize are also valuable foods. Barley meal mixed with an equal weight of wheaten flour is made into cakes in some parts, and eaten with milk. Barley forms good food. Pearl barley is barley with all the husk removed; it may be used in soups with great advantage, but it should be cooked two hours. Maize, or Indian corn, is comparatively little known in Britain, unless we except the preparation " corn flour," which is, we believe, made from Indian corn. If the flour of maize be mixed with an equal weight of wheat flour it makes, it is said, a sweeter bread than that of wheat alone. Maize is undoubtedly very nourishing, and the simplest way of using it is to stir it into boiling water until a sort of porridge is formed. It should be eaten with milk and sugar. Potatoes, Peas, Beans, and Vegetables.—Potatoes are not the best of food. They are eaten because they are cheap and abundant. Still, mealy potatoes go well with, meat; eaten alone they are not suited to support life. It is more economical to boil them in their skins than to bake them. Peas and beans are much more nutritious, and dried split peas may be used in soup and in pease pudding to advan- tage. Haricot beans also—which are the ripe seeds of a particular kind of French bean—might be used much more than they are. Both peas and beans, however, are difficult of digestion, and require to be well cooked. Haricot beans? indeed, should be soaked in water all night before being; used, and some authorities suggest they should be kept in a wet state for a day or two after being soaked in cold watery this process causiag the starch to be converted into sugar, and after being boiled for some hours, until they are quite soft, they will be found very nice. As to green vegetables, such as cabbage, their value is well known; they all form, wholesome food. Turnips form a very useful food; after boiling them, the water should be pressed out, and they may be mashed with a little dripping, and salted and peppered to taste. Tea, Coffee, and Cocoa.—Tea varies immensely, and so do opinions about this valuable beverage. Flat, washy teaDOMESTIC ECONOMY, 299 is bad ; very strong tea is bad also; but freshly-made brisk tea is distinctly beneficial. Very few people seem to make tea properly. The cardinal point is to use fresh water, freshly boiled, and to use it directly it does boil, but to see that it boils; the steam should jet out vigorously from the kettle spout. The reason for this is obvious; water boiled up twice becomes flat, and the point is to use it just as it is bubbling and effervescing with its first boiling. Then the teapot should be made quite warm before the tea is put into it; and all the boiling water for the tea should be poured on at once; in other words if you have sufficient tea in the pot fill it up at once. Tea should never be watered twice. Warren Hastings, our great Indian pro-consul, who may be supposed to have learned the value of tea in the East, never would permit this. As for the quantity, a teaspoonful for each person, and one for the pot, is a rough-and-ready rule which seems to work well. When the water is poured on, place the teapot near the fire for about five minutes or so, the point being to keep the water very hot, but not boiling, and not to stew the leaves a long time, otherwise the tannin may be extracted, which is indigestible. If there be no fire, place a cosey over the teapot after making the tea. After use, the tea-leaves should be removed from the pot at once and the teapot washed and dried. These details may be thought trivial but they cause all the difference between, good and bad tea, and while the one in moderation is bene- ficial to the system, the other is pernicious. Used tea-leaves may be sprinkled over the carpet when sweeping it, to help in laying the dust, and finally they may be burned. Should live animals be kept a few may be given to them. Coffee is more stimulating than tea and increases the heart's action. It should not be taken too strong or it may injure the nerves* Some people say it assists digestion ; others say it retards digestion, the truth probably being that if well made, not boiled, and taken in moderation it does not retard digestion: A Utile chicory may perhaps not spoil coffee. As in making tea, the water should be poured on directly it boils, and the coffee should be placed in a hot pot. The coffee ought not to be boiled. Cocoa is more nourishing than tea or coffoo and is on the whole more economical. Some people cannot take thick, heavy or fat cocoas, i.e., cocoa from which the natural makes light work of a heavy wash."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK, 3oo SUNLIGHT SOAP "butter" belonging to it has not been removed. Such persons should take the soluble cocoa, or extracts, that are sold. On the other hand if an infusion of the " fat " cocoa be permitted to cool, the fat solidifies on the top and can be removed; Alcoholic Drinks.—As a rule these are not necessary to health and are usually injurious, consequently they are not economical. People should avoid contracting the habit of drinking, whether alcoholic or other beverages. Too much fluid in the stomach produces ill-health. A certain exception may perhaps be made in favour of milk, because milk is such a nutritious food, but much fruit and many vegetables contain fluid in themselves. The body of course needs fluid, but there is all the difference between drinking to supply the healthy needs of the body and drinking for the sake of habit, even if the drink be non-alcoholic. It is the drink- habit as wasteful, uneconomical and positively unhealthy, that we are now denouncing. An enormous amount of money is annually wasted in drinks of various kinds that would buy better food, better clothes, better furniture, better books, better everything in short, and more of it. Remember then to avoid over-drinking even at meals ; it is distinctly unhealthy, as it lowers the tone of, and disorders the stomach; even too long a draught of water is bad, but as a rule the temptation to drink too much water seldom arises. Joints of Meat.—A good leg of mutton ought to be the most economical of joints. A 10-pound leg should provide a dinner for about 18 persons, or last three days for six people. Boiled beef is more economical than roast; but boiled neck of mutton is probably the most uneconomical joint you can buy. All bones should be stewed, as they make good "stock" for soup, as also does all the liquor in which meat has been boiled (see "Cookery"). All dripping should be saved and clarified; it is excellent for pastry, and at a pinch forni3 a good substitute for butter. Clothing-.—There are two objects to be aimed at in dress, though some people think there is only one—namely, adorn- ment. But the preservation of the natural heat of the body and its defence from the variations of climate and weather should come first. Flannel or woollen goods of some kindDOMESTIC ECONOMY. should be worn next the skin, while calico ranks next as a good material. Children require warmer clothing than their elders. Cheap, gaudy finery should be avoided. It fades soon and looks anything but fine. If clothes be good in material and well-made, they will look much better—if the person wearing them be well-behaved and well-mannered—than gaudy finery that is spoiled in the first shower of rain. But even good clothes will soon become shabby if left about carelessly. Dresses therefore should be hung up on a hook out of the dust when not in use, and a neat corner " cupboard " may be made for this purpose, as described under the heading, " Hints on Furniture." Or if to be used the next morning, the gown may be placed neatly and evenly over the back of a chair. The art of dressing well really lies in simplicity, with adaptations to figure and to circumstances in life. Many dresses and articles of clothing may be made at home, the great point being to get good patterns and good measurements to accurately suit the size and figure. Socks may be knitted, and crochet work trimmings made at home. Antimacassars as adornments for chairs can also be made at home. The number of economical things that may be done to make home pretty, agreeable, and tasty, and to make the best of what you have, are almost inconceivable. The point is to make up your mind to be self-reliant and do things yourself, without being moan or stingy, and it is wonderful how one success in this respect leads on to another. A cigar box may be turned into a pretty pincushion by odd bits of silk and padding, and art muslin ; small hampers similarly treated may form a most useful and ornamental piece of furniture for a drawing-room, while a square box, also similarly beautified, will do for a music waggon. Even a drain-pipe cleaned and painted, and with a bottom put to it, will answer the purpose of an umbrella stand. All these things may be done by the ladies of the house, for they are not arduous work, but, of course, taste and intelligence are required. . Th.e Right Way.-A great source of domestic economy is in learning to do things in the right way. There is a right and a wrong way of doing even the simplest things. The right way saves time, trouble, temper and money: the wrong way does the reverse. makes homes brighter and hearts lighter.ISO* "SUNLIGHT1' YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP is made in a twin bar NOTES ON GOOD BREEDING. The essence of good breeding is, after all, to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Thus, for instance, in Beginning an Acquaintance if a new-comer appear in your neighbourhood, it is only natural and right that the residents should call first upon him, or her, to give, as it were, a welcome. Then if the acquaintance be desired, first calls should be returned within the week, or ten days at most— unless some important reason, such as illness, prevent. If long delay elapse before the first call is returned—except for any special reason—it appears to indicate a disinclination for the acquaintance. But further, when persons have been called upon, but do not desire the acquaintance of those who have called, it is customary to simply leave a card in return for the call, without even asking if the lady of the house be at home. A lady also should leave her husband's card in the hall when visiting new acquaintances. On the other hand, if it be desired to pursue and increase the acquaintance, the first calls should be followed up by an invitation to a meal, or it may be to a dance, or evening party, or some entertainment at home, the new-comers receiving the offers of hospitality. Visiting, Introductions, &c—If kindliness and good- will are really the essential features of etiquette, mere formal or affected politeness soon palls, and it is doubtless this affectation that has brought mere " society rules " into some- thing like contempt with some people. Nevertheless, while a code of rules is certainly not needed for living with loved relations or well-tried friends—for here the heart dictates- yet with others, some idea of what is right and proper is of great assistance, for, as the old proverb has it, " Manners maketh man," and, of course, woman too. In Introductions, the gentleman should always be intro- duced to the lady, thus, " May I introduce [or, allow me to introduce] Mr. White to you, Miss Brown ?' Again the so-caUed "inferior" is introduced to the "superior in position, thus : " Allow me to introduce Mrs. Brown to you, Lady Smith." Be careful to pronounce the names clearly, so that each can hear the other name distinctly. If a person isNOTES ON GOOD BREEDING. 303 for the sake of convenience. very desirous of being introduced to another, you may say, <( Mr. or Mrs. Smith desires to make your acquaintance, il you will allow me to introduce [or present] him." At largs parties, introductions, except by request, are not necessary. Nevertheless, persons are often supposed to be unconscious of the presence of a stranger unless they have been introduced. In essence there may be something very salutary about this :Tule, but it is absurd, if not positively ill-natured, to push it &o extremes. Thus, if a small party meet, as at dinner, it ■would become almost ill-natured, and consequently ill- mannered, to refrain from any remarks of general conversa- tion throughout the evening until you are formally introduced. It may be taken for granted that the guests are present by special invitation and are consequently suited for mutual acquaintance. Nevertheless, the acquaintance need not bo renewed unless equally desired, and persons who have met in tikis way may appear as complete strangers next day. So with Introductions at a Dance. They follow the same jule, and persons who have danced together need not renew ^acquaintance, or even recognise one another, unless they choose, ior unless closely acquainted with friends on either side. The option of recognition rests with the lady; if she chooses to bow to a former dancing partner, she may do so ; but in no ucase should the gentleman show recognition first. Acquaintanceship in Business Matters (Avoidance of the Cut Direct).—Similar rules prevail here also ; the mutual .acquaintance of persons who have met "on business" need Ibe carried no further; but if they meet afterwards, and cannot avoid seeing one another, a slight bow or recognition may be given, as courteous and to avoid a direct and palpable *' cut." Persons, however, of ordinary tact and good feeling should avoid the " cut direct" by not seeing the slight or .business acquaintance they may not wish to meet. Disparity of Age between Persons Introduced.— Should marked difference in age, or in social position, exist between persons who have been introduced, the person .-markedly older in years or superior in station should make the tost advances. Between apparent equals in age or position the lady makes the first advances; but should there be marked superiority of age or station, the gentleman does so. If the"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. younger or inferior ventures on the initiative, he or she must be prepared for a politely haughty rebuff. Slight Acquaintances, Cards of Condolence, &c.— Slight acquaintances may call occasionally, or leave cards periodically, in return for a similar civility. Thus, for instance, after a formal introduction, cards may be left usually within a week; the initiative to rest with those as before stated. Young unmarried ladies may have their names printed on their mother's visiting card, underneath their mother's name. Further, at death, illness, or any event affecting the welfare of a family, acquaintances may leave cards of sympathy, condolence, enquiries as to health, &c, or if the event should justify it, of congratulation. A message may be given to a servant at the door. If intimacy and circumstances permit, a personal visit may of course be made, to rejoice with those who do rejoice, or weep with those who weep. Cards turned down at the corner suggest that they have been brought by a servant, or that the visitor had no intention of crossing the threshold. Concerning the acknowledgment of cards, when persons are in sorrow, enquiry cards may be left daily without return of the compliment. But when the affliction has ended, or is terminating, cards acknowledging kind enquiries may be sent in return, and are held to indicate that the family is ready again to receive visitors. After a funeral, visitors, unless they may be very intimate, and their good feeling and genuine desire to sympathise and comfort dictate a visit, are not expected until a week has passed, except at the door, and slight acquaintances postpone their visits longer still. Complimentary visits at certain seasons may be paid, or cards, such as Christmas cards, may be left on superiors in age and station. If after acknowledgments of cards have been made, the visits or acquaintance of an individual is not desired, such acts of civility should cease. But allowance should be made for varied circumstances —as for instance, the occupation of a person, or the calls upon her time, &c, and a lady or gentleman should not be quick to take offence if every little rule of etiquette is not accurately observed. Dinners, Entertainments, &c— Invitations to dinner are sent in the name of the gentleman and lady, as, "Mr. and Mrs. Brown request the pleasure, etc.," but invitations to SUNLIGHT SOAP is made of pure materialsi.\OTES ON GOOD BREEDING. u At Homes " (whether for dancing, music, theatricals, etc.) are sent in the name of the lady only, as "Mrs. Brown at Home." The day and date must always he put on invitations. If the invitation is for dinner, the dinner-hour is stated. If the card is for an " At Home," 4 to 7, or 9.30 to 12, is put, as the case may be. llefreshments for afternoon " At Home" are served in the dining-room, or in a tent upon the lawn, and consist of tea, coffee, ices, fruit, cakes, &c, and with or with- out wine and champagne, or claret cup. For evening "At Homes "on a large scale, a regular supper should be provided. Declining or Accepting Invitations.—As a rule, a person invited to dinner, or to an entertainment, should be careful how- he accepts it, unless he or she is prepared to make a similar,, or some return; for persons always dining at a friend's house and never giving a return do not appear to advantage, to- say the least. ^ In short, self-respect prevents persons from accepting civilities, or continually accepting civilities that they cannot adequately return. Nevertheless, travellers having no establishment of their own near by may unquestion- ably accept invitations to dinner, and are indeed, some say, expected to accept them; unmarried men, also, may accept such invitations, and inferiors may accept, without an "adequate" return being expected. But in declining, such invitations, care should always be taken to da so in a most courteous and polite manner. It is most important that invitations to dinner should be answered at. once. Some thoughtless people defer doing so for several days, and the hostess is thus caused serious inconvenience by being kept waiting to know if all her guests are coming, for if not, she may have to obtain substitutes, and this is often difficult, or impossible at short notice. Having accepted the invitation to dinner, or At Home, or party, when the time arrives and you enter a crowded room go as straight as you can to the hostess. The rule is to notice no one until you have presented yourself and bowed to the hostess, and of course the host also, should he be welcoming guests with her. If sufficiently intimate, the nostess offers her hand, the visitor then makes a remark or two, and retires to make way for other guests. A gentleman may find a chair for himself, or stand, or may for the sake of quality.3o6 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. SUNLIGHT SOAP is made in a special manner walk about; the ladies often sit, the hostess finding them seats, or deputing others to do so. At dinner parties the host or hostess also generally indicates to the various gentlemen the ladies they shall ask to take in to dinner from the draw- ing to the dining room. When dinner is announced, the host leaves the drawing-room first, giving his arm to the lady of highest rank, the hostess comes last with the gentleman of highest rank. Gloves are not removed until the guests are seated at table, then they are taken off at once. After dessert the lady of the house makes a slight bow to the lady of highest rank present, the ladies then go to the drawing-room, the host holding the dining-room door open as they pass out, the othor gentlemen also standing as the ladies leave the room. The ladies leave the dining-room in the same order of precedence as they entered it, the lady of highest rank going first, the hostess last. Luncheons are less formal than late dinners and a luncheon is often a good, substantial meal. Gentlemen belong- ing to the family need not appear until the repast is served and may retire directly the meal is concluded; the idea being (that they have professional or business duties to attend to. If gentlemen are invited as guests, the husband or some male relative of the hostess is expected to be present to receive them. For a lady to receive gentlemen at luncheon, by invitation, and in absence of the husband or head of the house, is not "good form." Unless particularly requested, guests should depart at the conclusion of luncheon. Ladies may appear in ordinary walking or morning attire and the trouble of " dressing for dinner " is avoided. Servants do not usually wait at table at luncheon after the joint has been 16 Shaking Hands.—A gentleman should never be the first to offer to shake hands with a lady, except in cases of very great intimacy, or unless he be the superior of the lady in age and in position. Unmarried ladies, as a rule never offer to shake hands with gentlemen who are but slight acquain- tances. Sufficient and quite polite signs of recognition are a bow or slight curtsey on the part of the lady, responded to by a lif ted hat, or bow,.on the part of the gentleman Further^ in shaking hands, there should be but a slight or gentle pressure and a slight movement from the wrist.NOTES ON GOOD BREEDING. 307 for the sake of effectiveness. At Homes have of late become a very favourite method of receiving frier is, possibly because they afford a wider latitude of choice in the entertainment provided than any other reception. At an "At Home" a hostess may simply remain in her drawing-room on specified days, when the time may be passed pleasantly in conversation, and light refreshments, such as tea and light bread-and-butter or cake, may be offered. Should there be a formal invitation to the " At Home," however, the sort of amusement pro- vided will be placed on the cards of invitation, and of course, more elaborate preparations must be made to entertain the guests. Sometimes afternoon " At Homes" are called Kettledrums, and they are really informal tea-parties, held between the hours of four and seven. Tea and light refresh- ments are served, and servants wait on the visitors. Morning dress is worn, ladies wear their bonnets, and gentlemen may take their hats with them into the drawing-room. The idea is that guests enter and leave at their convenience, and that the whole is a pleasant and unceremonious method of seeing friends. Formal introductions are not considered necessary except among very exclusive people; nevertheless, the host and hostess should make a point of introducing desirable acquaintances to one another and must do their best to put everybody at their ease. Many hosts and hostesses seek to attract celebrities of some kind or other to their assemblies. General Hints.—Do not introduce people to each other if you have any cause for supposing that the introduction may not be mutually agreeable. There is no need for a lady to bow to a gentleman who has been her partner at a dance unless she wishes to do so. When a gentleman is introduced to a lady at a dance he should always at once ask her for the pleasure of a dance, and, unless she does not intend to dance, ehe is bound to accept. A lady should not dance more than two or three times in one evening with the same gentleman unless she is engaged to be married to him. A young lady should never accept presents (unless it mav be flowers or bonbons) from a gentleman unless she "is engaged % it mamed to him- When engagements are broken on all letters and presents should be returned on both sides.3o8 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK, HINTS ON FURNITURE. Gone is the fashion of horsehair chairs in vogue in the earlier Victorian era, and gone also are the ideas of horsehair sofas, of rosewood furniture, and heavy gilt frames. Fashion changes in furniture as in dress, "with, however, this consoling proviso, that if genuine and well made, good furniture must always be useful, if not decorative, or exactly fashionable; and when the whirligig of change places it again in vogue, it will rise considerably in value. Such has been the case, with the Chippendale and Sheraton goods—the "spindle-legged" furniture, as some people have not inappropriately called it. Thomas Chippendale migrated from Worcester to London about the time that mahogany was coming into vogue, and he made his furniture of that sound and beautiful wood. The curves and lines of his productions are excellent—some say perfect—and his chair- backs are carved open-work. The legs of his tables and chairs are very slender ; but it is said he never " inlaid " his work, so that if any broker or auctioneer tries to sell you an " inlaid " piece of Chippendale furniture you may question its genuineness. f Sheraton, however, inlaid his goods; indeed, " inlay ' forms one of his characteristics, while his " legs " are more spindle- shanked even than those of Chippendale. He also liked carvings of wreaths of flowers, musical instruments, or draperies. Time passed, and the fashion for these things passed away. The furniture of Sheraton and Chippendale and of another maker, named Hepp el white, who nourished about the same time, sank in price and popular esteem, so much so that it was regarded as "old rubbish." Much that was massive, pretentious and expensive came into vogue ; but that style has now declined in its turn, and fashion went back to the " spindle-legs." There has been a great unearthing of the once-called "old rubbish" and lumber-rooms and curiosity shops have been made to yield up their dusty treasures. Prices, of course, rose accordingly. m Good modern furniture may, therefore, be made in these stvles, and look very pleasing, and afford great satisfaction, without being genuine Chippendale—that is, actuallymade SUNLIGHT SOAP is made atHINTS ON FURNITURE, 30§ by that great furniture artist 150 years ago. In fact, a little taste and a little care may furnish, a house even fashionably, at comparatively small cost.

SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. 3io some dark red wood from the West Indies, and Mrs. Gibbon, wanting a new candle-box, her husband ordered it to be made of the new wood: He desired the box to be ornamental. The joiner was like his tools, he turned aside from the task, for, said he, the wood is so hard, tools won't work it. Dr. Gibbon insisted that harder tools should be found, and he had his way, and the box was made. It was the first article made in England of mahogany, and was much admired. Then Dr. Gibbon had a bureau made of the wood, which was polished with linseed oil. Mahogany became popular; men saw there was money to be earned by importing it; and Chippendale arrived to make good use of it. Satin wood came in some years later, and rose into great vogue, being also frequently used with tulip wood. All kinds of woods are, of course, now used for furniture; but one of the points after all, in choosing furniture is to see that it is thoroughly well made, and that the joints are firm. Showiness of appearance may cover loose, badly-constructed joints, and ill-seasoned, if not even warped wood. The old " kings " of furniture-making seem to have always selected thoroughly well seasoned and finely-grained wood; and if you select modern furniture having the same qualities you will have a good article, even if not quite in the fashion. But, in fact, much modern furniture is made "in the fashion," and very accurate and harmonious it is. If sold as "modern" Chippendale, or in the Chippendale or Sheraton style, it need not be outrageously high-priced, but may be very satisfactory, and even " fashionable," all the same. Variations of these styles also may produce very satisfactory results. Ebony was also introduced during the seventeenth century, having come to Europe from the Portuguese settlements in, India. Admirably carved specimens may be seen sometimes in old country houses. Ebony was fashionable to an extent, but was always rare, for the wood has only been imported in small pieces. A so-called Dutch ebony cabinet of the seven- teenth century has been exhibited in the South Kensington Museum, beautifully carved with mythological subjects in relief. It is called Dutch, but no doubt it was the work of French artisans who fled to the Netherlands after the revoca- tion of the Edict of Nantes. Comfort also must be considered.

It should "be polished now and again, and an excellent furniture polish may be made as follows :—Mix thoroughly 3 oz. of beeswax, 1 oz. of white wax, 1 oz. of Sunlight Soap, 1 pint of tur- pentine, and 1 pint of soft water; keep the mixture two days before using, apply it lightly to the furniture and polish off with a silk handkerchief. Walls, Ceiling and Floors.—Bear in mind, when furnishing and decorating a home, that great expense is not necessary if you will but use a little ingenuity and intelligence. It is not merely the lavish outlay of money that will make a harmo- nious, elegant, and tasty home. For the walls, instead of papers which may be badly designed and very gaudy in colours, you may, if you like, produce cheaply harmonious tones in any tint by means of distemper, which you can put on yourself. You may use, for instance, a good shade of terra-cotta for the walls, and modify the tint for the ceiling according to taste. The room will look like the interior of a rosy-coloured shell, particularly if the idea of harmony be followed out in the di aperies instead of contrast. For this purpose a bold-patterned warmly-tinted " art" muslin may be used. " Art " muslins of good designs and of every colour can now be bought at a draper's, at about threepence per yard and upwards. The Distemper for the Walls and Ceiling is really a coloured whitewash, but some size must be put into the mixture, or the colouring will rub off the wall when dry. A good recipe for whitewash for an ordinary room is as follows :—Place two cakes of common whitening in a pail and mix into a thin paste with warm water; lib. of double size should be melted in an old saucepan and added to the white- ning in the pail; a smaU cake of laundry blue, previously dissolved, should be added, and finally a tablespoonful of ground alum. The mixture will effervesce when this is added, and when the bubbling is over the stuff may bo strained through a fine sieve or coarse canvas; when cold it is ready tor use. Wash off tho old whitewash and dirt before applying. Any tint mav be given the whitewash by colours procured at the oil-and-colourman's.

How to Furnish a Room Cheaply and Beautifully.— A good proportion for distemper is ten parts of whitening to one of coarse size, the colour being added when diluted with a little water, and of a consistency resembling cream. Distemper should be slightly warmed when used. Eemember too that distemper will dry on the walls several shades lighter in colour than it appears whilst wet. An admirable effect in colouring might be produced if you were to distemper your wall a shade of grey-blue, and the centre flat part of your ceiling with the same colour, making the cornice moulding biscuit colour. Fix all round the room a dado three or four feet high, of ordinary Indian matting, headed by a beading of split bamboo cane, which can be obtained at very little expense. # , The floor may then be painted all round m a deeper shade of blue, and well varnished over when dry, using the same colour for wood-work of the door, window sash, etc., or, if preferred, paint these latter a cream white, cover the centre of the floor with a square of deep crimson felt without pattern, and you wiU have, at trifling cost, a room that will always be a pleasure to use. . Such a room may be furnished with bamboo-cane chairs, and fitted with an overmantel and little book-shelves painted white, like the door and window sash, and the effect would be charming. A carpenter who understands the use of a lathe would make the overmantel and book-shelves, and you will m this way get them at much less cost than if you bought them already made, besides the advantage of having them according to your own design and fitted before- hand to the places in which they are to be finally fixed. Variety also can be obtained with a little forethought; for instead of the split bamboo beading, you might run a little shelf a few inches wide all round over the matting, and use it for holding ornaments or books. Also, if ™V°*ta£ to economise space, you might, instead of a set of shallow shelves, say seven inches wide, all lound the room, with doors to each compartment; these shelvescould be ued instead of an ordinary sideboard, ^ ^ to^up much less room; and if the doors were_panelkdjhe^ ~~ sunlighYsoapTHINTS ON FURNITURE. 315 be effectively painted in the colours of your walls and wood- work, or if you wanted to use them as book-shelves, you could have wire doors, showing through them the colours of the books themselves, which form excellent decoration. A Cheap Corner Cupboard for Dresses.—In a bedroom much may be done to economise space by enclosing a corner as follows :—Have a three-cornered shelf, three feet deep ifi its widest part, fixed up sufficiently high to allow hooks to be placed inside around the two angles of the wall, on which to hang dresses, &c.; then hang a curtain of the same material as your window curtains, bed drapings, etc., from the front of this shelf, and you at once have a three-cornered wardrobe m which you can hang a number of garments with safety from dust. J Substitute for Wardrobes, &c—Ordinary deal boxes frilled round with art muslin, and with a frilled square of the same material, make excellent substitutes for drawers in which to hold evening dresses, linen, etc.; or make admirable otto- mans m a sitting-room; and one great advantage is that the art muslins used for these ottoman curtains, etc., can be washed, and made to look as good as new by any lady, and with only a few minutes' trouble, by Sunlight Soap. They require no rubbing, and can be washed in any ordinary small foot-bath or large washing basin, if done according to the directions given with the soap.

The basis is generally "stock," •or liquid in which lean meat or bones have been simmered. The meat should be cut into small pieces, and the bones •should be well broken; a quart of water may be used for every pound of meat. Let the water heat slowly and skim off the scum as it rises. Do not permit the water to boil, except gently. When the scum seems all removed, add the vegetables, such as one, or perhaps two, turnips, an onion with cloves stuck in it, parsnips, carrots, and a few sweet ■herbs. Add salt to taste after the meat is cooked. The mixture may be set aside to cool till morning, and the fat ean then be taken off. Much waste in the kitchen will be prevented by having a stock pot and making good use of soups. A stock pot with special construction maybe bought, but any pot with a lid will do; if it is of iron, however, it should be well tinned inside. Into this every scrap of kitchen waste, except fish, should be put—bacon rinds, bones (crushed^ or chopped small), &c, with water, and it should be stewing (again we any not boiling) on the fire whenever the hob is not •occupied with anything else. It is better not to put vege- tables into the stock pot, but all vegetable scraps (except potato parings) should be boiled by themselves, and the water strained from them makes an excellent addition to the stock when it is made into soup. The water that meat—salt or fresh—or fowl has been boiled m, should never be thrown away; put it into the stock pot instead. In summer, stock needs boiling up every day to keep it from turning ; but in winter, stock that is coated with fat (as it always is when cold) will keep good in a cold larder for a fortnight. A Good Beef or Mutton Soup.—Cut up £ lb. lean beef or mutton; wash a £ lb. rice, and cut up a I lb. each of turnip, carrot, and tomato; the meat and vegetables may be cut to about £ in. square. Cut up also 3 stalks of celery very small, or, if you prefer, SUNLIGHT SOAP,"COOKERY RECIPES. 317- 3 sprigs of parsley. Place the meat with. 4 quarts of cold, water in a saucepan, and let it boil gradually; add the^ vegetables, and salt and pepper to taste, and boil gently until the food is tender. To bring up the quantity to the 4 quarts, add boiling water. Potato Soup (without meat, cheap and excellent).—Shred and simmer 6 potatoes and 2 onions in a little water. When soft, rub through a colander, or sieve, and mix with, milk to make of the consistence of cream; add pepper and salt to taste, a piece of butter, and boil up. May be served with chopped parsley or powdered mint sprinkled over soup in tureen, if flavours are liked, and with fried bread squares. Cabbage Soup.—Take 2 pints of stock {see above) a head of cabbage, 1 tablespoonful of butter or dripping, pepper and salt, and a tablespoonful of flour. Boil the. cabbage, strain and chop it fine, put it into the pot with, other ingredients, except flour, boil up, have the flour mixed smoothly with a little water (corn-flour is much better than ordinary flour), stir it in and boil till the soup thickens. When flour is used as thickening for soups, sauces, &c, they should always be boiled for at least five minutes after it ia added or the flour will taste raw. A Good " Baked Soup."—A nourishing and substantial winter soup. The writer of Tasty Dishes says : Ingredients.— 2 lbs. lean beef, 1 head of celery, 2 turnips, 1 teacup of chopped cabbage, 1 onion, 1 carrot, chopped parsley, 4 or 6 tomatoes (or i tin preserved tomatoes), | cup of rice pre- viously boiled for 15 minutes, pepper and salt, 5 pints of cold- water. Method.—Cut the meat into dice, peel and chop up all the vegetables, add the rice and seasoning, mix all well together, and put into a strong earthenware jar, pour in the water, fit the cover on closely, and set in the oven in a pan of boi mg water for 6 hours. Do not uncover it while it is cooking, and serve without further preparation. Carrot, Haricot Bean, Lentil, Green Pea, Oxtail soup, dec—h or all these soups, good stock, as already directed, may be taken as the basis ; lentils and haricot beans must be soaked beforehand for a few hours (beans all night), m cold water, and then stew in the stock until done. Many cooks then rub the soft haricots or vegetables through a sieve.. 27 Gold Medals and other Awards.3i8 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. Salt and pepper to taste, also add such herbs as desired to flavour. Oxtails should be cut into joints and fried before simmering in the stock. Purely Vegetable Soups ; Purees —Chop up the vege- tables and simmer gently in water; then after half an hour, If desired, add cabbage, which must have been previously partially boiled ; then, after about a quarter of an hour, add tomatoes if desired and sweet herbs, and boil up for nearly half an hour. Mash through sieve, and add a little butter and milk (thickened with flour as directed for cabbage soup, if desired), and boil a minute. In a somewhat similar manner purees of separate vegetables, as of tomatoes, may be made, II.—Boasting. General Rule.—Meat should be put into a very hot oven, Or before a strong fire for the first ten or fifteen minutes, then the oven should be cooled a little or the joint drawn further from the fire for the rest of the cooking, in order to preserve the juice in the joint. Average Time required for Roasting.—Fifteen minutes to the pound, and add fifteen or twenty minutes to the entire time required for cooking the joint. Veal and pork always require twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over to the entire time. These meats must be done through to the lone. Fowl require plenty of basting. Economical Leg of Mutton.-A large leg is more economical than a small one. Have it neat y cut m two Take out bone from thick end, fill space with stuffing made of bread scraps wrung out of cold water, and mixed with chopped dripping, pepper, salt, parsley, herbs, and a little shred lemon peel? b££ up tightly, cover with greased paper, and bake; or fiU with mashed chestnuts or mashed potatoes and onion as for a goose. The knuckle end, boiled with caper or parsley sauce, will make another day's dinner. Savoury Mock Steak made without Meat.-Take.one pint of dried haricot beans soaked for 24 hours in cold water Q till tender (two or three hours). Put some dripping and tSo sliced onions in a frying pan and fry a golden brown add beans, with pepper, salt, and chopped parsley fiy for ten minutes, drain off dripping, and arrange in neat form on a hot dish. . . See smiling faces all aroundCOOKERY RECIPES. 319 Mock Rabbit (cheap and very nourishing).—Prepare haricot beans as above, but instead of frying, put them, when sufficiently boiled and drained from the water, on a deep, hot dish and cover—for the mock rabbit—with onion sauce, or to represent chicken, with parsley sauce. To Cook New Zealand or other Frozen Meat.—This meat is often despised because it is badly cooked. It should always be thoroughly thawed before cooking—this is the secret of success. Let it hang in a warm kitchen all night. Canterbury (New Zealand) lamb is regarded as the best of all the foreign brands imported. To Clarify Fat or Dripping.—Much dripping will accumulate during roasting, and should be clarified. Break iUp-5 £d,npi)Jng and scraP8 of fat a basin, and pour on a kettleful ot bating water. Next day the fat will have formed a cake on the top j cut it off, if possible without breaking, scrape all the impurities off the underside, wash out the basin break up the cake, and repeat process, and then again a third time. Beef dripping is much nicer for cookery purposes than mutton dripping ; if possible keep them separate. ILT.—Baking. General Principles.—The rules and times for roasting apply equally to baking. Bemember that a very hot oven is needed to row bread and pastry, then a cooler oven to permit mside to be gradually cooked. Game, hares and other delicate meats should be covered with greased paper, or larded (i.e have thick slices of fat bacon tied or skewered on) before being put m the oven; this also saves the need of such frequent basting. Meat pies when brown enough should be placed on the top of the oven, to allow the meat to cook slowly and prevent the crust from being over-done: the crust ff ne7f ^h paper during^this process.

Baked Codfish.—After soaking the fish half an hour in cold salt water, wipe dry and stuff with a little seasoning; then bake, with thin melted butter poured over it, in a moderate oven for about an hour, or till done, basting if it should show signs of browning too quickly. Baked Lemon Pudding.—Beat the yolks of 4 eggs to a froth; mix in 4 ozs. pounded sugar, and i lb. warmed butter ; stir well, and add grated rind and juice of a lemon. Line a dish and cover it with puff paste and bake forty minutes. A Good Batter Pudding.—Take 4 eggs, separate the yolks from the whites, beat well separately; then mix them very gradually with 8 or 6 ozs. of flour and a trifle salt; add a little more than a pint of milk. Put in a buttered dish and bake in a quick oven for three quarters of an hour. Baked Fruit Batter Pudding.—These may be made with almost any fruit; if apples are used, peel, quarter, and core them first, and add a little grated lemon or pounded cloves. The fruit should be placed in a well-buttered dish, and then the batter poured over to fill it. Good Pie Crusts.— (1) A " Common" Crust for Raised Pies.—A £ lb. butter and £ lb. of lard should be melted in % pint of hot water; when melted, pour the liquid into 2 lbs. of flour in a basin, stirring all the time. Then work the mixture into a stiff paste with the hands, and before using it, place it on the hearth, covering the basin with a cloth. (2) A good " Dripping " Crust. —"Rub 6 ozs. of nicely clarified beef dripping," says Cassell's " Dictionary of Cookery," " into 1 lb. of flour. Add a pinch ~" SUNLIGHT SOAP you find the best. ^322 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. of salt, a small teaspoonful of baking powder, and a table- spoonful of sugar. Make tbe mixture into a paste by stirring into it £ pint of water, and roll it out two or three times." (3) Bard Crust—"Rub i lb. of lard into 1 lb. of flour, add a pinch of salt, and make it into a paste by mixing with it a cupful of water. The unmelted lard, freed from skin and thinly sliced, makes very good pastry; but a mixture of lard and dripping, or lard and butter, makes a better crust than lard alone." (4) A Good Butter Crust for Fruit Tarts.—Mix 1 lb. of dry flour with a trifle of salt and 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; then crumble into the mixture 6 ozs. of fresh butter, which has been cut into small pieces, and work up the whole into a paste with a little new milk. Roll out two or three times, adding two more ounces of butter as you do so, but handling it as little as possible; use a moderate oven for baking." A quick, light, dexterous hand is best for making PaBaked Rice Pudding.—To make a plain baked rice pudding, wash about a teacupful of rice, put it in a pie dish, sprinkle a little sugar over it and add a trifle of grated lemon peel-or any pouring desired; add 3 pints of cold milk and a^ little bit of butter, also currants if desired Bake m a gentle oven until a brightish brown skm forms on the top.

A Good Cake.—Mix lbs. of flour and I lb. of brown sugar; add half a teacupful of good yeast and a I pint of lukewarm milk, stirring the while; knead.all well together to dough and set it to rise near the fire. When the dough has risen add £ lb. currants, or a teaspoonful of caraway seeds and £ lb. melted butter in J pint of milk. Knead once more and let the dough rise again near the fire. Put in tin, and bake for about an hour in a moderate oven. A Superior Macaroni Pudding.—Boil inch lengths of macaroni in milk till tender. Thinly line a pie dish with pie- crust. Nearly bake it and place inside the macaroni and milk and add beaten eggs to almost fill the dish; sweeten to taste, and bake the whole in a gentle oven; the preparation must not boil. Queen Cakes.—Mix together 1 lb. each of dried flour, sifted sugar, and clean currants. Beat up 1 lb. of butter, and mix with it 8 eggs (whites and yolks beaten separately), add the dry ingredients by degrees. Then beat the whole together, some authorities say for an hour. Place the batter in little tins or cups and sift fine sugar over as you place in the oven. IV.—Boiling. General Principles.—Meat, boiled to serve as a joint, should be put into fast boiling water, which should boil for at least five minutes; if the joint be large, allow ten minutes ; the pot must then be drawn to the side where the water will only simmer gently for the rest of the time of cooking. The gentle simmering permits a slow, steady heat to penetrate to the inside, which cooks the meat without depriving it of its juice. But in boiling meat and bones for soup-stock and beef-tea the opposite principle must be observed, because the object is to extract the juices, and so get all the flavour and nourish- ment out of the meat and bones; therefore, they should be chopped up and put into cold water, which should gradually come to a simmer until the meat is " done to rags," and the bones become bare and marrowless. The lid should always be kept on while stock or soup is making in order to preserve Why not get SUNLIGHT SOAP—the Best ?324 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. the flavour and goodness. Quarter hour to the pound, and one quarter hour over to the entire time. This is only average time—as the quality and size of joint must be considered. Veal and pork need longer cooking than other meat. Fish.—Put fish into cold or tepid well salted water. Some cooks, however, make salmon an exception to this rule, and use boiling water, which certainly causes the fish to be of a better colour. Very small fish are better steamed (for large fish allow £ lb. salt to a gallon of water, for small fish 4 ozs. to gallon), if this is omitted the fish will not be so well flavoured—and bring quickly to boiling point. If the fish is very big and thick the water may boil rather briskly till it is done; but otherwise fast boiling will cause the outside to be cooked and break to pieces before the inside is done. The fish-kettle or saucepan should be filled, and the fish laid into the water. Turbot should be rubbed over—on its white side—with a cut lemon before cooking. About ten minutes to the pound. Here again size and shape influence the time, a thick cut of salmon may need nearly double this time. Fish is very injurious if underdone. The flesh, if done enough, should easily separate from the bone. Fowls should be put in hot water, not salted, and the water • ust only simmer ; if it boils too fast the fowl will be ragged. The lid of t£e pot should be kept on while boiling meat, fish >r fowL Chickens twenty minutes to half an hour. Fowl half to one hour, according to size, Turkeys, one and a half urs for moderate sized bird. bs Vegetables.—Put green vegetables after washing them well, and new potatoes into plenty of fast-boiling well-salted water, and boil fast with the lid off. The exception to this rule is spinach, which must be put into a pot with only the water that clings to it from washing, it Trill cook in its own juice. Old potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, dried peas and beans are put into cold water. Potatoes largo, old, require from twenty minutes to half an hour. Asparagus, spinach, seakale, sprouts, cabbage, take twenty minutes to half an hour. Old carrots require long boiling to make them tender. ckimming.— In boiling all kinds of food skimming is most important. As the scum rises it should be removed, or If you wish your linen to be as white as snow,COOKERY RECIPES. 325 both flavour and appearance will be injured. Remember that nothing should remain lying in the water after it is sufficiently cooked. Fish and vegetables are especially injured by this. Puddings.—Plum pudding can hardly be boiled too much; two hours to the pound is the least time that should bo allowed. Meat puddings, one hour to the pound, longer than this will do no harm. Apple pudding, roly-poly, &c, half hour to the pound. A Good Lemon Pudding.—Mix together \ lb. bread- crumbs, £ lb. fine chopped meat, £ lb. sifted white sugar, and the grated rind of 2 lemons, add the juice of 1 lemon, and finally 2 eggs beaten up ; place in a buttered basin and boil for three quarters of an hour. A Good Boiled Plum Pudding.—Mix together £ lb. of chopped-up beef suet, f lb. of flour, £ lb. of. bread-crumbs, £ lb. of stoned raisins (some cooks like to chop them also), £ lb. of currants, £ lb. of moist sugar, the chopped-up peel of a lemon, and half a grated nutmeg. The dry ingredients having been thoroughly mixed, 6 well-beaten eggs should be stirred in, or 3 eggs and 3 full teaspoonfuls of baking powder—also as much milk as is necessary to make a stiff paste. Tie the pudding in a floured cloth, but not too tight— bo that it may have room to swell; plunge it.juato boiling water and boil it for five hours. The puddingy should not be taken out of the cloth until just before it is eaten. Hunter's Pudding.— If minced cooked meat be used for this pudding instead of suet, the pudding may be eaten cold and slices may be taken by those whose avoca- tions lead them for hours away from home or restaurants. "Mix^ lb. of finely-shred beef suet, with a £ lb. of bread- crumbs and a £ lb. of flour, add £ lb. of stoned and chopped raisins, £ lb. of picked currants, ^ lb. of sugar, the grated rind and strained juice of half a lemon, a pinch of salt, half a nutmeg grated, and 1 oz. of candied lemon. When the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed, stir in 4 well-beaten eggs, and either milk, beer, port wine, or brandy, sufficient to make a stiff batter. Put the mixture into a buttered mould, and boil six or seven hours. This pudding will keep for several months, and when used may be either cut into slices and SUNLIGHT SOAP will make it so.326 " SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. fried, or plunged again into boiling water and boiled for an hour. Several puddings may be mixed and boiled together, and are very useful for keeping in the house to be used as occasion requires." A Good Pudding-crust for Boiled Pudding.—Suet or butter must be used—lard is not nice for these puddings. (1) A Butter Crust.—Mix well together 1 lb. of flour, half a teaspoonful of baking powder, and a trifle of salt in a basin ; then rub in 6 ozs. of fresh butter. Make the mixture into a paste by working it with a fork or knife, and adding \ pint of water; roll out once or twice,-and it will be ready for use. (2) Suet Crust.—The skin must ha carefully removed, and the suet must be cut up as finely as possible, a little flour being strewn over it two or three times to keep it from sticking together. Mix 6 or 8 ozs. of the suet to 1 lb. of flour with a trifle of salt, and work th9 mixture into a firm pasta "with cold water. Almost any kind of fruit may be) used for puddings with these crusts. Butter should be rubbed on the inside of tho basin, which should then be lined with the crust, the -°rtdt put in, and then covered with the crust.

(strained), and a couple of well-beaten eggs; place the mixture in a buttered basin or mould, tie in a well-floured cloth, place in boiling water, and boil quickly and con- tinuously. An ounce of ginger, or J lb. of chopped figs may be used instead of the chopped-up lemon rind, and the lemon juice may or may not be omitted, according to taste. "High Church Pudding."—Mix thoroughly & lb. of finely-chopped suet, £ lb. of flour, a teacupful of black- currant jam, teacupful of milk, and a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Stir these together a few minutes, add, if liked, a tablespoonful of sugar. Butter the inside of a plain basin or tin shape, put in the pudding and boil 2£ hours. A Good Rely=Poly Pudding.—Knead 1 lb. of flour into a paste with a little milk—tepid in winter. Roll out the paste on the board, placing on it from time to time little bita of butter, and keep on rolling and placing in little bits of butter until you have used £ lb. Then roll out the paste to size of your pudding—as long as your saucepan will take— and spread over it the jam you intend to use ; then roll the jam and paste over itself and work the ends together, so as to close up the jam well inside. Flour over, tie in a cloth, tying the middle and ends of the pudding with string, and place in a saucepan of lolling water, and keep boiling for three hours. Have a kettle of hot or boiling %ater near to fill up the pudding saucepan as the water therein evaporates* V.—Stewing. General Principles.—This is the most economical of all methods of cooking. The meat should be fried first for a minute on each cut side to keep in the juice, and then put into the stewing pot (either a regular stewing pan, or an ordinary saucepan with a close-fitting lid) with a very little water or stock, and with or without vegetables. Very little fire is- needed for stowing as the process should be a slow one; for this reason, that all tho goodness of the meat is preserved in the gravy. ev/ed Celery.—Cut tho celery into 3-inch lengths; wash in cold water, place in boiling water or broth co that they may be covered and keep to that level by filling up with cleans clothes and almost anything els2.328 " SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. milk. When tender, thicken the liquor in which the celery has been boiled with a little flour, and butter, pepper, and salt to taste. VI.—Steaming. The General Principle consists in putting the article to be cooked into a basin or jar, covering it with a cloth wrung out of boiling water and floured, or a greased paper, and placing it in a steamer. If this is not at hand the basin or jar may stand in a saucepan of boiling water, which should only reach half up its side. VII.—Frying. General Principle.—Plenty of fat (lard or dripping) should be used, except for chops or steaks. To know if fat is the right heat for frying fish, cutlets, &c, pour a drop or two of water on to the pan from a spoon. If it hisses the heat is right. To Cook a Chop or Steak in the Frying pan.— Have a strong iron frying-pan (not an enamelled one), place it on the fire till it gets almost red hot, put on the steak or chop with a pair of tongs (sugar-tongs will do, or use two spoons), and turn every ten seconds. From six to twelve minutes will cook chop or steak, according to thickness. ' Broiling is done on^a gridiron over a clear fire. The difficulty of always being sure of a clear fire makes the above method of frying a beef-steak very useful. A griller on a gas stove is also very serviceable. Sauces (for Fish, Meats, and Vegetables).—Economical substitute for melted butter—Blend quite smoothly 1 table- spoonful of corn-flour in a little cold milk or water, add 1 pint of boiling milk. Stir one way, and boil for five minutes. This can be used as a fish sauce by adding either lobster, oyster (tinned or fresh), shrimps, anchovy, hard-boiled eggs, chopped gherkins (for salmon), ^rsley, or ketchup, or mustard (for herrings), with a little vinegar and cayenne. As a meat sauce, add capers or parsley for boiled mutton, or boiled onions for shoulder of ditto. For fowl add parsley ot celerv (boiled and chopped), or pickled nasturtiums, or mush- rooms. For rabbits, add boiled onions. Equal parts of milk Prize Dogs and Poultry should beCOOKERY RECIPES. 329 and water can be used, and does very well instead of pure milk. A piece of butter or dripping can be added at discretion. Parsley should be well washed, boiled in water for a few minutes, and chopped fine before, adding. Sauce for Puddings.—One full tablespoonful of condensed milk, 1 pint of boiling water; thicken with corn-flour as above. To this may be added (for plum pudding) if desired, rum, or brandy, or Marsala wine. For other puddings, chopped almonds, or preserved cherries or ginger—or any flavouring, such as vanilla—or lemon juice; but a glass of Marsala will be found to suit general tastes best, and it is good with any kind of pudding. No sugar is needed. A few drops of cochineal or spinach juice will colour it pink or green. VIII.—Eecipes for Invalids. Beef Tea.—One pound of beef (weighed without fat, bone or skin), 1 pint of cold water. Mince the beef and place it in a jar with the water. Stand the jar, covered closely, in the oven, which must -be only very moderately hot, or into a pot of cold water, which should be gradually brought to a simmer, and allowed to simmer round the jar from two to four hours or more. The beef tea must never boil. An egg whisked, or milk, or strong gruel added to beef tea makes it nourishing, or the beef tea may be made with the water in which haricot beans have been boiled. Plain beef .tea is only a stimulant. Chicken Tea.—Chop either a whole fowl, or a joint of one, email, put it in a jar, without water, cover closely and cook as directed above. The resulting juice will be small in quantity but of concentrated strength, and excellent for a sick person.' \ Arrowroot.—Blend a dessertspoonful of arrowroot smooth m cold water, pour this into £ pint of boiling water or milk stir while boiling for three minutes. May be thinned with milk or wine or brandy added. Gruel.—Mix well 2 tablespoonfuls of coarse oatmeal With £ pmt of milk (or water), strain, not through a sieve but through a strainer, into a saucepan, place on fire and stir frequently, boiling for about fifteen minutes. Add salt or sugar to taste. washed with SUNLIGHT SOAP.33° " SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. Barley-water.—Wash two tablespoonfuls of best pearlI barley in cold water (see it is not in the least musty). Put it. with a quart of water into a saucepan and boil slowly for am hour, adding sugar to taste, and flavour with the very thinly-- cut yellow part of lemon rind, or lemon juice. Strain into a jug. The longer it boils the thicker it will be. Apple Tea.—Eoast 5 or 6 apples, put them into a jug. with sugar to taste, and a thin strip of yellow lemon rind, pour, over quart of boiling water. Stir till they are broken, cover, and stand near the fire for an hour. Strain and cool. Whey.—Add a glass of Marsala to J pint of boiling milk for white wine whey ; boil up, sweeten, strain. ■ Treacle Whey (Good for a cold).—Add treacle instead of wine. Cold Whey (A cooling drink).—Add a little rennet to hot milk. Stand in a warm place. In fifteen minutes beat up: curd, strain off whey. Cup Pudding for Invalids. — A small teaspoonful of flour, a trifle of salt and a dessert-spoonful of cold water; then pour in a teacupful of boiling milk, stirring all the-: time ; when cold add a well-beaten fresh egg ; see that: the mixture is quite free from lumps; sweeten with a little? sugar ; pour into a buttered basin and bak° for about: twenty minutes. Note on Digestibility of Food.—Boiled food is more easily digested than fried food. Hot food is more easily digested than cold food. Liquid food is more easily and quickly assimilated than solid food, but it should not be swallowed down too quickly; rather it should be taken in sips. Sunlight Soap in the Kitchen.—Sunlight Soap is an indispensable accessory in the kitchen—every wooden and. china utensil can be washed quickly and thoroughly with it. It will keep kitchen and dish cloths sweet and clean with the; minimum amount of trouble. Lifebuoy Soap is in a specia*. manner the cook's Mend. If she has to cut up « high meat or game she should directly afterwards wash her hands and the knife with plenty of Litzbuoy Koyal DismPECTANT Soap. ' Take"life easy, use SUNLIGHT SOAP. ~HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 33* USEFUL HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. To Clean Silver and Electro=plate.—Wash with Sun- light Soap daily, and polish, with, a leather; plate-powder will not be needed. If a coarse soap be employed, the free alkali will do much damage, as it corrodes all metals. To Clean Mackintosh Bed=sheeting.—The Lady Super- intendent of a Children's Convalescent Home writes:—" Dip the sheet in water. Bub Lifebuoy Soap lightly all over it. Eoll the sheet up and place in water for a while. After a little lapse of time remove and swill well with clean water.' The dirt is completely removed, without labour or injury to the cloth." To Clean and Restore Painted Walls and Woodwork. —Take a pailful of tepid water, two sponges, and a tablet of Sunlight Soap. Apply the soap to the painted wall or woodwork with one sponge, and remove the soap and dirt with the other sponge; rinse the latter frequently, and change the water often. Some soaps are likely to be too highly chemicalled to use on paint. Sunlight Soap is mild, but very effective. The Journal of Decorative Art writes (March, 1893)—"Were Sunlight Soap more generally used we feel convinced that we, as a trade, should have less work, for it is admirably adapted for washing paint, and as it contains no free alkali does not take off the surface of the paint together with the dirt." To Clean, or Wash, a Carpet.—Boil or dissolve Sunlight Soap m the proportion of half a tablet to four quarts of water, and when cooled so as to be just comfortably hot to the hand, wash the carpet well from seam to seam, only washing about ©ne yard at a time, and using a "loofah," a sort of rough washing-glove, which may be purchased at a chemist s. Then rmse quickly and thoroughly with clean, soft water (rain water if possible), rub dry with a clean cloth, then proceed with the next yard of carpet. In this way the carpet will not be soaked, because it will be quickly dried ' and it is a very much better plan than washing the wholeV carpet first, and then trying to dry it. Should the carpet be nailed aown, and it is impossible or undesired to take it up and hang it out to dry, then as little water as possible must SUNLIGHT SOAP, largest sale in the world."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 333 be used, and each piece must be rubbed nearly dry before proceeding with, the next piece. Doors and windows should be opened also to admit a current of air, otherwise the carpet may c o n t i nu e damp and rot. To Keep Car- pets C1 e a n.— When sweeping Turkey, Axmins- ter, or any thick piled carpet, always brush the way of the pile. By doing so, they will last fresh and bright for years, whereas if done the wrong way, i.e., against the grain, the dust will thoroughly penetrate the carpet, and it will Boon be rendered dingy and shabby. To Clean or Scrub Rooms, Baths, etc.—Use Sunlight Soap ; it makes the boards white. But for sick-rooms use Lifr- buot Soap, which is a disinfectant. Scrub the way of the grain of the wood; use plenty of clean, warm water; wash and dry one part ci - timo, as far as the arm can reach; do not put more n zicr r? *,o ooards than is necessary to make them clean, as they will take very long to dry if made too wet. When scrubbed clean, the boards must be well rubbed with a clean house fhinel wrung out of clean water, then with a dry cloth, the way of the yrain. If boards are not well rubbed and uricd they will not, even after a good scruobing, be a good colour. When you have finished with the scrubbing brush do not leave it to soak in the bucket; this treatment softens thehjres, or bristles, v^hich should be hard. l.mse the brush under the tap and hang My ro dry. After cleaning a room, leave open windows and doors, and do not lay down carpets and rugs until the boards be dry. Never moms bedrooms late in the afternoon. They should be dry before they are slept in, or serious iUness may result. It is said that in some districts where women leave the cleaning till Don't worry! Use SUNLIGHT SOAP.HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 333 Saturday, many more cases of croup occur on Saturday night than on any other, because the children sleep in damp rooms. Also, if possible, never scour out a room on a wet day. To Clean the Enamelled Paint so much used for bed- room suites, nothing will be found better than Sunlight Soap, because, being free from any caustic alkali, it will not damage the lustre of the enamel. To Clean Marble.—Wash the surface with warm water and Sunlight Soap, polishing afterwards with a fine dry cloth or leather. But if stained and much soiled, boil equal parts of Sunlight Soap and powdered whitening, say 4 ozs. of each, with 1 oz. of soda in ^ a little water. When thoroughly blended, lay the mixture on whilst hot; let it re- main a day or so. Wash off with clean water and dry with a leather; the marble will be much im- proved.

For those who have no knife-cleaning machine, this plan will be found very useful. If white knife handles be discoloured rub with salt moistened with Sunlight Soap suds. Tinware may be cleaned splendidly if rubbed lightly with Sunlight Soap and polished as above. To Clean Stains out of Knife Blades.—Eub the blade on the cut half of a raw potato, wash with Sunlight Soap, and polish with a little fine bath-brick or knife powder. To Clean China and Ivory Ornaments.—China orna- ments should always be washed with Sunlight Soap, as it does not injure the gilding. Wash ivory ornaments with a small brush in Sunlight Soap and water, place them wet in the sunshine, then wash them again, and they become beauti- fully white. To Clean Lamp Globes.—Dissolve and use Sunlight Soap in the water in which the globes are washed. After washing, the glass should be well rinsed in cold water, and then set to drain where the water can run off, and the globes will dry rapidly. To Clean Feathers, or Pampas, and other Dried Grasses.—Dissolve the half of a tablet of Sunlight Soap in two quarts of boiling water; put it into a basin and beat to a strong lather with a wire egg-beater or a bundle of birch twigs; use while warm. Hold the feather or grass by > the stem in the left hand, dip it into" the soap liquor and squeeze it through the right hand, using a very moderate degree of pressure.

Cleanliness is Next to Godliness they say, but many people make home an ungodly place from bad temper when their nerves are all unstrung with their efforts to be clean. This would not be the case if they had a proper help in house-cleaning—and the best help women ever had—one who will not want " wages," nor " beer money," " evenings out," nor even "followers," is the silent friend in the paper wrapper, labelled— "SUNLIGHT SOAP." CONCERNING THE HAIR AND SKIN. Brilliantine (a nice dressing for Eough Hair).—Eau de Cologne and Lever's Glycerine, of each 1 part; honey, 2 parts; rectified spirit, 4 parts. To Cleanse a Scurfy Head, Lifebuoy Soap will be found valuable. Wash the scalp well with it and hot water once a week. Sunlight Soap is the best thing for washing light-coloured hair. It cleanses thoroughly. It is highly recommended for this purpose by Lady Mary Shelley. Tor washing dark, dry hair Quillai bark is excellent; and can be bought at any chemist's. Tie a bit in muslin and shake it well in a basin of warm water till a lather forms. The hair needs cleanliness and fresh air. Plenty of brushing is most important for its beauty. Heavy, warm head- coverings, which prevent the escape of the exhalations of the scalp, are very injurious to it. Lime Juice and Glycerine, for strengthening, cleansing and beautifying the hair.—Lime juice, \ pint; rose water, \ pint; Lever's Glycerine, 2 oz.; rectified spirit, 2 oz.; oil of lemon, 30 drops. Glycerine and Lime Cream. Ditto.—Lever's Glycerine, oil oi sweet almonds, and lime water, of each 4 ozs.; tincture of cantharides, \ oz.; mix and add perfume to taste A little to be rubbed into the roots of the hair if it is falling m Skin.—To preserve the beauty of the skin a good soap is important. Coloured, highly-scented soaps are very injurious, and frequently lead to skin eruptions. Sunlight Soap is otten thought to be unfitted for toilet use, but we have two important proofs that this idea is quite erroneous. One is the336 "SUNLIGHT" YEARBOOK. ~When SUNLIGHT SOAP is used testimony of no less a person than Sir Charles Cameron, M.D., and he gives the best proof of the value of Sunlight Soap for everyday toilet use, by saying thathe uses it himself. The other is the testimony of a physician whose speciality is skin diseases. The guaranteed purity of a well-known article which is used by millions of people, and into the manufacture of which scientific knowledge enters, should convince us that it is a cleanser which cannot injure the most sensitive skin. Wash for Irritable Eruption cn Scalp or Face.— Toilet vinegar, 6 ozs.; Lever's Glycerine, 2 ozs. For Sunburn (very Cooling and Healing).—Chop up a fresh cucumber, and squeeze out the juice in a lemon squeezer. Mix this with a like quantity of Lever's Glycerins and rose water mixed together in equal parts. Complexion Powders are very injurious to the skin of tha face. They, even if innocent in themselves, fill up the pore% cause them to enlarge, and so cause the skin to become coarse. Fuller's earth is the least injurious of all toilet powder? except boracic acid powder, which is the best of all for use aa a dusting powder after the bath. It is an antiseptic powder and scented with orris root or otto of roses, makes a delightful powder for use after exercise. The Hands.—A very simple method of keeping the hands in good condition is to wash them frequently (particularly after doing work that soils them much) with Sunlight Soap and hot water, drying thoroughly, and then rubbing in a few drops of glyeerine(uae Lever's) and rose water. These should be mixed in equal parts and kept in a small bottle on the Washstand, Glycerine and rose water is specially recom- mended for rough hands by Dr. Malcolm Morris, the eminent skin specialist. He particularly condemns the use of pumice Btone for the hands. If an old pair of soft suede gloves be kept for the purpose of sleeping inland glycerine and rose water be freely rubbed in before bed-time, and the gloves drawn on without drying the hands, they will soon become aa eoft as satin. Eose water can be cheaply bought at any chomist's. A Perfect Nursery Soap.—The skins of infants and young children are much more tender and easily injured thanHOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 337 those of grown people. Coarse, coloured soaps may cause serious skm eruptions. Sunlight Soap may be safely used for the new-born baby's bath. On account of its purity it is a perfect Mrsery Soap, and will cause no roughness to the delicate skm of the youngest child. It is also the best soap lor washing children's hair. r Miscellaneous. wSre i°f +?e?r?°mf ~A Tlai'Se' clean> wi-ite apron should1 be worn by the bed-maker.

Should the stopper still prove refractory put a few drops of oil round it where it enters the glass bottle and warm before the fire; then hold the bottle between the knees (or in one hand) and tap the Btopper gently on alternate sides, with a small piece of wood and directing the strokes upwards. Continue this process, giving more drops of oil, warming afresh, and rubbing the neck briskly with a piece of list until the obdurate stopper gives way. To facilitate it, however, take a needle or a steel pen, and run it round the top of the stopper in the crevice or angle formed by the stopper and the bottle; then hold the bottle m the left hand and twist the stopper steadily toward you with •your right. One of the simplest methods, and very useful if you have no hot water at hand, is to pass a piece of list ■round the neck and then draw it vigorously backward and -forward by two persons while the bottle is held fast, inis 'operation warms the glass and frequently enables the stopper to be turned by the hand.

It may be used to varnish, unpainted wood. To Remove Tea, Wine, or Fruit Stains.—Fresh stains on linen or calico may easily be removed by steeping it in plenty of cold or tepid soft water, then put stained part while wet over a basin and cover with salt; after a few minutes pour hot water over it. If the stain is an old one, proceed as for old ink stains (see below). To prevent the stain spreading, use a basin only large enough to hold the stained part. To Remove Iron-Mould or Ink Stains from Linen.— If the ink stain is slight and quite fresh, soaking in muk for some time and then well rubbing with Sunlight Soap and cold water, and leaving to soak roUed up for twenty-four hours, will generally remove it. If, however, the stain has dried in, and is dee and of large ontent, proceed as follows. Put the stained part into a soup plate or dish, cover with salt and lemon-] uice mixed into a rather liquid paste. Leave it to soak in this for twenty-four hours or more, rinse in cold water; if stains are still visible repeat process, using fresh salt and lemon-]uice. Then rinse well, lather with plenty of Sunlight Soap and warm water, roll up tight in water, and wash out after twelve hours. The linen is not injured by this method, as destructive rubbing is avoided, and stains will be entirely removed. {Also see under " Laundry. ). To Remove Paint Marks on Clothing.-When fresh, these can easily be removed by rubbing with turpentine or paraffin applied with a bit of cloth. If they have dried on, rT w?th a mixture of equal parts of turpentine and pure alcohol, and clean off with benzine. To Clean Laces.-Cover an ordinary wine bottle with fine flannel, stitching it firmly round the bottle.

It is Important to remember that different fabrics need different treatment. You should not wash a flannel shirt as you would a cotton sheet, if you wish your laundry work to be successful. All white goods (cottons and linens) are washed in tha same way with Sunlight Soap as follows :— Cotton and Linen Goods.—First soak them for several hours (twenty-four, if possible) in cold water, then wring them lightly out, have a tub of hot water ready, dip each article into it, then draw the article out on the wash board and rub the soap lightly but thoroughly all over, leaving no part unsoaped. Then as each article is soaped roll it up tightly and let it lie in the tub covered with water. If there are a large quantity of things of course more than one tub may be needed, and it must be remembered that table linen should not be washed in the same water as body linen, and that very dirty kitchen cloths should be washed last. ' Leave them lying rolled up in the tub under water for at least half-an-hour; but if they can be left for an hour or more it will be all the better. The soap will do the cleansing work while the things are lying quietly in the tubs. At the end of an hour or two the articles must be unrolled and rubbed lightly out on the wash board. The dirt mil come out idthout any trouble, as the Sunlight Soap has thoroughly loosened it. The things must be turned insula out and thoroughly soused and worked m the water, li tna water becomes very dirty before all the things m the tub are finished pour it off and add some clean hot water to tho tuo —but there is no need for any more soap or for washing through two suds (what is called by washerwomen seconding, or for scalding or boiling, but if there are any very dirty streaks, as at the neck, &c, rub some more soap on that; part, and roll up again for a tar minutes, washing that part carefully. When all tho things are finished wring them lightly, squeezing the soapy water out and rinse u£ thoroughly in another vessel of warm water.

"SUNLIGHT SOAP—an absolutely pure soap.THE LAUNDRY. 343 By this method of washing, all boiling, scalding, and blueing are rendered unnecessary. Thus the laundress is spared standing m an atmosphere of steam, and is not exposed to the sweats consequent on working in it, and one of the principal dangers of laundry work is avoided. Sunlight Soap purifies and whitens, and the clothes washed with it never have that peculiar and unpleasant smell imparted to them by soda and coarse soap. The house, instead of reeking with the "smell of washing," is scented as if with the perfume of hayfields.

The things are wrung out of the cold soak, put into the machine and the handle turned for about fifteen minutes. But no matter how good the machine, the neck bands and very soiled parts will afterwards need hand washing, so that these machines do not save all hand labour. The rinsing and wringing must be done as already described when the things leave the machine. A wringer undoubtedly saves much labour and wear and tear, | To Remove Mildew from Linen—Ordinary washing win not remove mildew marks from linen. Moisten a tablet e£ .Sunlight Soap and rub well into the marks, cover the soaped Dart thickly with finely-scraped chalk, press it into the linen, and lav it in the sun, or in the air, or upon the grass; when nearly dry, repeat the process. This must be done three or four times till the mildew comes out. ' Flannels and Woollens.—Soap must not be rubbed upon •flannel and woollen goods.

Fill a tub (or the bath) with tepid water, and soak the curtains in it for some hours. After this has been done, let the water off and refill the tub with vory hot water.

Then take fjr2^ each curtain separately andi jump it well up and down in: the water. You will almost see the dirt fall out.

Be careful to pour the boiling water on slowly, as, if too much is added, the starch will be too thin. The amount of starch made will depend on the number of things to be starched. Boiled starch can be used hot or cold, but must not be kept too long, or it will become watery. This recipe is for a small quantiy. Cold Starch.—One tablespoonful of starch, mixed with about half a pint of cold water, which should be added gradually, blending the starch with the back of a spoon, till the mixture is of the consistence of cream, then stir a piece of Sunlight Soap round and round in the starch several times. Cold starch is best made with soft water, or water softened by the addition of half a spoonful of powdered borax (which has been previously dissolved in two tablespoonfuls oj boiling water), to the half pint of water. The use of a little Sunlight Soap rubbed into the starch is a very great improvement upon the old plan of using turpentine to prevent the starch sticking to the iron. Turpentine makes the linen yellow, unless it is used with the greatest care, and imparts a very unpleasant smell, and, as turpentine is highly inflammable, it is much safer out of the laundry. To Starch Shirts, Cuffs, Collars.—These things must, be perfectly clean and quite dry before they are put into the starch. Prepare cold starch, as directed above, in a clean basin. The starch must be as thick as cream, but not lumpy, and should be well stirred up from the bottom of the basin; dip the things into it, and well rub and soak them m the starch for a few seconds, squeeze them out, and roll up tightly in a clean cloth. They must then be left for about an hour, so that the starch may soak in. In starching < shirts, only the cuffs, collars, and fronts are dipped in this way, not the bodv of the shirt. _ . , ™ To Starch Table-Linen, Muslins, &c—For these boiled, starch should be used. It should not be stiff enough to stick, firmly to the fingers. Dip the things into it, squeeze them, pull them straight, and roll in a dry cloth. Muslins, lace and fine things must first be shaken, and clapped between the hands before being roUed in the cloth. They must always- Kid before they are ironed, then sprinkled with clean Water, rolled in a clean cloth, and, if possible, mangled^THE LAUNDRY. 351 they are ironed. For fine laces, white sugar makes a sufficient stiffening, and is easier and better to use than starch. Put two or three lumps of loaf sugar into a small basin half full of hot water. When the lace is washed and dried, dip it into this basin and hang up the lace, dripping, to dry, draw it out with the fingers when dry, and clap in the hands. This is better than ironing for fine lace. Ironing.—Gas stoves are now made very cheaply for heat- ing irons. They are cleanly, economical, and cooler for summer use than a fire. Be very careful to keep the irons clean. Some silver sand or powdered bath-brick should be ready, spread on a large paper, upon which to clean the irons. It is much better to have a special ironing board when washing is done at home, than to depend upon the kitchen - % ^ table. The board should = be quite smooth and free from uneven joints. Two or three folds of clean blanket, free from seams, should cover it, and over this a clean sheet or calico be spread; this must be quite smooth and free from seams or darns, which would become printed off on the ironed linen. If the sheet be tacked to the blanket underneath the board, it will save trouble. For ironing skirts and shirts, skirt-boards and shirt- boards are speciaUy made, and are a great help and con- VCH1QHC6 * 1 T^1™" * and Co»ars.—Take the shirt out of the cloth in which it has been rolled up after starching, shake out and pull straight, leaving no creases, and rub well aU over tne part that has been starched with a clean cloth, so as to eave it smooth and free from starch on the surface.

SUNLIGHT SOAP neckband, and lastly, the fronts. A small ironing board that: goes under the fronts is a great help in ironing shirt fronts: properly; they must be perfectly smooth and glossy, and; should be finished off with a polishing iron (a specially made; heavy flat iron rounded at the bottom and very bright). It: must be rubbed and pressed firmly on the linen, using as-: much force as possible, which gives a beautiful finish to the? surface. Proper stiffness cannot be obtained without a veryi hot iron, but it must always be tried first on a piece of old; linen, for fear of scorching. Always iron cuffs and collars,, after rubbing well all over, to free from loose starch and. creases, on the wrong side first, then on the right. They? must not be too dry before they are ironed. If creases form: in ironing, they are made worse by trying to iron them into, the linen; rub them out, if possible, by damping the places slightly, and smoothing out the crease. Starched things,, especially shirts, collars, and cuffs, should be dried welL before a hot fire after ironing. They will then be much, stiff er. Muslin, Laces and Fine Things.—Muslin, laces, and', fine things, should be ironed on the wrong side, the way oil the selvage, and should be damped by sprinkling witbn clean water beforehand, and a cloth should cover them, over which the iron is passed. Prints (except black or navyr blue) should be ironed on the right side to make them, glossy. Flannels must never be ironed with a very hot irom or they will shrink, and they must be ironed on the wrong* side before they are quite dry. To Remove a Scorch from Linen. — Chop up two? onions and squeeze the juice out by wringing in a cloth,, ct in a lemon squeezer, add this to half a pint oL vinegar, half an ounce of Sunlight Soap, and two ounces of fuller's earth, boil this till thoroughly mixed.

Mangling.—Sheets, body Hnen, etc., must be quite damp before they are mangled, and should be placed quite smooth between the roUers. If possible, one person should hold and.THE LAUNDRY, 353 smooth the linen as it passes through the mangle, while the other turns the handle. Creasing will thus be prevented. Mangle large things and small things separately. Always take care that buttons, hooks, etc., are inside the folded linen before mangling, otherwise they will be smashed in the process. To Remove Iron=Mould.—Place the iron-moulded part stretched tight over a small bowl three parts full of boil- ing water, so that the steam may come through the fabric. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in a dessert-spoonful of lemon- juice (this answers as well as salts of lemon, and has the advantage of not being poisonous as is salts of lemon, nor so injurious to the fabric), dip the feather end of a quill pen or a bit of cotton-wool in this, and rub over the iron-mould till it disappears, dipping the material then well into the bowl of water. Afterwards rinse very thoroughly in plenty of warm and then cold water. Eemember that if iron-moulded things are put into the wash with other things, the iron-mould will spread to. everything it touches. makes linen whiter and homes brighter. NSUNLIGHT SOAP HOW TO READ THE GAS-METER. On every meter there are three dials, as here shown—the one on the left hand indicating even ten thousands up to 100,000; the next even thousands up to 10,000; the third even hundreds up to 1,000. The meter, as shown here, reads 59,900. To prevent Gas=Meters from Freezing.—Unscrew the brass tap on top of the meter, and pour in a quarter of a pint (four ounces) of Lever's Glycerine. This should of course be done at the very beginning of frosty weather. It may be mentioned that sometimes in exceptional frost the gas is frozen " at the main " outside the house ; under these circum- stances no treatment of the meter will, of course, be of any good.

Some women seem to have an in- stinct for making pretty hats. A few touches here and there, with a few poses of the head to this side or that, to watch the effect; and, behold! the whole aspect of the hat is changed and it looks bright and suitable. Artificial flowers of all kinds are being pressed into the service, and one pretty composition is the Lily of Fig. 1.—The Lilt of the Yalley hat.

Feathers, in fact, are to some ex- tent being eclipsed by flowers as adornments for ladies' headgear, and this change—as involving less cruelty in killing birds—is satis- factory. Some women go too far, and turn large hats into perfect flower gardens. Snowdrops, violets and daffodils appear, then roses, pansies, and primulas, poppies, daisies, geraniums, and even holly- hocks. Of hollyhocks, indeed, an -A Pretty Rose Hat. makes homes brighter and hearts lighter.358 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. aigrette can easily be maae, and an effective hat has been made of ivy-leaves with an aigrette of hollyhocks. Roses also may be treated in the same manner (Fig. 2) with other flowers or leaves. Indeed, the variety seems infinite. Some hats have been con- •structed entirely of flowers, pansies being great favourites for this pur- pose. As to size, it is not surprising that large hats are popular, for, in fact, many women look much better in large hats than in small. A pretty Paris hat (Fig 3), is made of yellow fancy straw, with a broad brim turning slightly behind. From the crown stand out loops of black mousseline de soie, all round, star fashion. On either side a bouquet of cowslips, or may be other suitable Fig. 3.—A Paris Hat. flowers, nestles between the loops, ■while yellow silk ribbon loops and four black wings fill up the vacant space behind the black loops; a cache-peigne of cowslips being placed under the brim at the back. Nevertheless, feathers are not quite out of fashion, though they have so largely given way to flowers. Yet a pretty hat may be made without flowers by raising up an "aigrette" of three ostrich feathers with suitable ribbon frilled round. (Fig. 4.) A very simple yet pretty child's hat may be made of pink Tuscan straw, trim- med with a wreath of white daisies, shaded pink (about three deep) and tied on the left side by an upright bow of fairly broad, white satin ribbon. For autumn or winter all kinds of picturesque little Dutch bonnets may be worn, but the "Daisy" hat, i.e., having a wreath of daisies round the crown, is pretty and useful in summer.

A pretty high-crown hat has some light trimming, say goffered chiffon, or lace, ot mousseline de soie on either side, a couple of ostrich feathers on the left, two or three flowers on the right, and a light ribbon or bow in front (Fig. 5). This hat is also much simpler than some of the gorgeously beflowered structures which have been in vogue. As for the material for hats,, coloured straws seem to have super- seded the felt " Plateau " of a few seasons since. The "Plateau," it may be remembered, was nipped up in the centre, a process which caused it to undulate round the edge, while underneath was a velvet under-brim or bandeau; now "plateaus" in coloured straw have come in, and they are usually made up over an under-brim of black lace or chiffon, with ostrich tips as the top trimming. A simple but elegant Parisian hat is thus described: the shape is, somewhat like that of the centenarian "box" or "top" hat, with the two; sides waving upward and the top of the crown a little longer than the lower part. The material is of finely but plainly plaited straw, green in' colour, and the edge binding and, three bands round the somewhat} high crown are of a darker shade of green velvet, while three ostrich tips of feathers of the same tint rise from^ the left side. Here again we see Fig. 6.

It can be made to fasten down the front with a basque, as an ordinary tight-fitting jacket, or in Eton or " Bolero " style. The braiding may be in rows of narrow black braid; the lining is, of course, . important, and may be of satin, while the sleeves should be very full, and descend to the elbows. The lonnet is a pretty " Breton," made of white lace over white satin, and trimmed with pink roses and green ostrich feathers. The " Sac " Coat may not appear pretty, but has become fashionable with some. It may be made of fawn-faced cloth, and is cut just down to the waist.

The abscess may thus be regarded as an effort of nature to rid the system of the bad matter in the blood, but this effort is attended with' great pain to the patient. Belief is obtained by opening the abscess—when sufficiently large and matured—by a lancet—an operation which should be performed by a doctor. Fomentations of hot flannels wrung out of boiling water may be applied to accelerate the. growth. Linseed poultices may also be applied for this purpose, and about ten minutes before the poultice is used the abscess should be smeared over with a mixture of equal parts of Lever s glycerine and extract of belladonna.

But as a rule it is well to foment and poultice the part as directed and so bring out the bad matter from the system. The abscess should be allowed to discharge itself and not be pushed or pressed with the finger. People should liveon pure and wholesome food, practise great cleanliness in person and dress, using plenty of Sunlight and Lifebuoy Soap, avoid all inflammatory drinks and exhausting excesses, and they would in all probability never suffer from these painful sores. The patient should be careful to live well, but on plain, nutritious and digestible diet. Ague.—Abo called intermittent fever, as the attacks recur in paroxysms. Each attack has three stages: (1) the cold fit with chilliness of the body, aching of the limbs and chattering of the teeth ; (2) the hot fit, accompanied by thirst, headache, hot flushings, and high pulse, followed by (3) the perspiration stage, when gradually the patient feels relieved. Each stage lasts about two hours. Further there are three types of ague, the quotidian, when the patient suffers a paroxysm daily; the tertian, when a patient suffers every other day, this is the most frequent type; and the quartan, in which the attack comes on every fourth day. Causes; Marsh malaria, living on low and marshy ground, &c. Eemedies; Warm baths, °and warm non-alcoholic drinks, such as barley-water, &c, also, m the hot stage, saline draughts are beneficial; but the specific remedy is sulphate of quinine, 2 to 5 grains being a dose and taken perhaps three times at intervals between the attacks. Anaemia.—Poorness of blood. Sometimes occurs alone, but is often one of the symptoms of other complaints. Young women poorly nourished suffer most from this evil, and often exhibit great pallor of face and lips, with a wax-like com- plexion. Palpitation of the heart arises, the appetite is poor, and the patient suffers much difficulty in doing her work. Tonics such as quinine and iron are useful, and the patient should take plenty of wholesome and nourishing digestible food, not omitting fat, and exercise in the fresh aiS ine dialysed iron is a good form of taking that medicine, as it does not constipate the bowels.

One teaspoonful of the oil and 7 or 8 drops of the iron in half a wineglass of water, but not more, may be taken three times a day directly after meals. Do not exceed this dose. The easiest way is to dip a spoon in boiling water, and put the dose into the hot spoon, off which it slips easily. Angina Pectoris.—Severe pains in the chest with feeling as of death coming on through suffocation, and arising after exertion. The anguish and dread suffered by the patient are extreme; the complaint is associated with disease of the heart in some form or other. A competent medical man should be consulted, but in general habits of life all excesses should be absolutely avoided, also excitement of the mind, or any over-exertiun of the body; hypodermic injections of morphine are sometimes given to relieve the pain, also ether or chloroform is inhaled; while the inhalation of nitrite of amyl in some cases acts almost like a charm. The complaint is however far too serious for amateur treatment. Carry out the doctor',s directions implicitly and preserve absolute calm- ness—though not stagnation—of mind and body. Aphonia.—Loss of voice. Usually results from bad con- dition of the throat and larynx as in ulceration, or inflammation of the vocal chords. Exposure to severe cold and sore throat cause some people to lose their voice. A mustard plaster over the throat, also the inhalation of steam, are useful remedies, while the application of a solution of nitrate of silver to the vocal chords, should they be inflamed or ulcerated, is recommended, but this remedy must be applied by a medical man. Aphonia sometimes arises from over-straining the voice. Among the remedies are rest and bathing the throat in cold water, afterwards briskly rubbing it to pro- mote a glow and strengthen it. {See also Sore Throat.) Apoplexy. —A rush of blood to the head, with a great pressure on the brain, producing insensibility as a consequence; or a blood vessel in the head may burst and blood overflow on the brain. A patient sometimes falls suddenly, and becomes unconscious, the face is flushed, breathing heavy, pulse slow; or the attack may be more gradual, the patient sinking slowly into a state of insensibility and never rallying. Once more, the patient may suddenly lose the power of speech and also power on one side ot me "IsUNUGHT SOAPTTHE HOUSEHOLD DOCTOR. z?l body, but lie still retains bis senses. Paralysis frequently accompanies or follows apoplexy. The attack is difficult and dangerous to treat, and professional assistance should at once be sought, but the doctor may reside at some distance and much depends on prompt treatment. The head should be raised above the level of the body and cold-water bandages applied and kept cold. The feet and legs should be placed m a hot bath and weU rubbed when taken out; all clothes around the neck or throat should be loosened or even removed. Ergot may be given to check the bleeding and a motion of the bowels should be obtained as soon as possible. Attention should be given to premonitory symptoms, such a 3 excessive drowsiness, intense and throbbing headache, any- thing m short which suggests fulness of blood in the head Abstemiousness in diet should be sedulously cultivated attention paid to regular action of the bowels, and cold water bandages applied to the head. Asthma.- A complaint of the breathing, occurring in paroxysms and accompanied with tightness over the chest and by wheezing. The distress is often veiy great, as the patient anticipates suffocation every moment. It is a ^0n$1fated ?0I1'T>laint> and though alarming, yet it is not in itself fatal; it often leaves a cough and is sometimes accom- panied by bronchitis, disease of the lungs, or affection of the heart. _ The causes of asthma are somewhat obscure, some authorities stating that disorder of the stomach is at the root oi the matter, yet atmospheric changes have sometimes much to do with it. The immediate cause is said to be a spasmodic action of the air tubes of the lungs. Whether due much or little to stomachic derangement, asthmatic sufferers should be very careful about their diet: it must be simple, nutritious and very digestible ; the last meal should be digested before going to sleep. Should the stomach be full when an attack supervenes a spoonful of ipecacuanha wine as an emetic will give relief. Smoking well-dried stramonium leaves is a good remedy.

Stramonium, .we may add, is also known as "thorn apple," and it acts as an anti-spasmodic, and as an anodyne. Should patients not liko to smoke it, an infusion of it in hot water may be inhaled. Atrophy (Wasting away).—Indicates diseased action of some vital organ ; or a want of nourishment; or an inability to assimilate nourishing food; or some exhausting complaint draining the system ; worms may cause atrophy. The organs in which -the deficiency of vital force exists should be discovered, and if plenty of wholesome, nourishing food, fresh air, healthy exercise, cold bathing, judiciously practised, do not effect a. cure, and the atrophied or shrunken parts do not begin to regain their natural, healthy and rounded form, other measures must be adopted, and a reliable tonic, such as steel and cod- liver oil or syrup of hypophosphiteg may be taken. A skilled physician, should be consulted. Consumption, and bad dyspepsia (indigestion) may. cause atrophy. . 'i Baldness.—Also called alopecia,, or loss of hair. This complaint, if such it may be called, is common enough. It is caused by the atrophy of the follicles, on which the hair depends for nutrition. Impairment of the general health may cause bald- ness, also worry and overwork. Continual washing with cold water, followed by friction with a rough towel, and Spanish fly ointment may also ^ used. Doctor Kesteven has recommended the following as a lotion, -tincture of cantharides (Spanish flies) \r oz., and spirit ot rosemary 6 ozs.

In the case of dog bites, the wound should be tied tightly above the bitten spot until strong caustic can be applied. Even after a scratch, a stick of lunar caustic may be applied as soon as possible. Here again the aid of a doctor should be sought, and we only indicate what may be done until his arrival.

Carbuncle.—A large sore, resembling a boil, but much larger, and attended with great inflammation and a burn- ing pain. The treatment should be much the same as tor abscesses and for boils, but carrot and turnip poultices may be applied. The cause is no doubt due to a vitiated condition of the blood, and medicines to restore a healthy action to the secreting organs should be taken. Chapped Hands and Lips.—Cracks in the skin, which may become very painful. Washing in warm water and then exposure to cold is almost certain to produce "chaps." Lover's Glycerine, mixed with rose- water, is a good remedy. Chicken - pox.—A feverish rash.—The rash consists of little round spots on the body, the spots not depressed in the centre, as are the spots in small-pox.

When the griping pain ceases in the bowels, a few drops of tincture of camphor may be taken. In Asiatic cholera the discharge is not bilious, as in the former case but thin, colourless, and watery, and is called "rice water evacuation." Cholera sometimes commences like an ordinary attack of diarrhoea, which may last a day or two, or only a ±ew hours, but often it begins suddenly, with severe vomiting and purging, followed by great pain and cramps. The evacuations become watery, and the vomiting is so great that nothing is kept on the stomach. Thirst arises (caused by the .fluid drained away in the purging and vomiting), also pros- tration and collapse. When the diarrhoea and vomiting cease, semi-stupor intervenes, and cold sweat covers the 6km; from this stage few recover. At the first symptoms the. paUent should be put to led and the doctor sent for at once, it the patient be over seventeen, twenty drops of laudanum may be given; but if under, give only one drop for ZlllVf a9\ ^lve 7lce ^ smaU Feces, as much as the patient likes.

The neglect of domestic and personal cleanliness is a great inducement to cholera. The use, therefore, of plenty of Lifebuoy Soap to easily keep everything clean as a new pin may be regarded as a great preventive. Colds (cold in the head).—Never neglect a cold. The symptoms are too well known to need description. The homely remedies of a hot foot-bath, hot gruel, and a good night's rest should be used at once, and bronchitis, pleurisy, &c, mav be avoided. Constipation.—Want of movement of the bowels, lake fruit with breakfast, or before it, and use fruit constantly m the daily diet. Baked apples and stewed prunes are very useful. Salad dressed with salad oil may be taken freely if digested, also green vegetables. Some persons find a glass of hot or cold water, according to taste, before retiring to bed, and also before rising in the morning, useful in this complaint. Coffee or cocoa should be used instead of tea, and fresh, bread and cakes avoided. If arising from weakness of the system rest is desirable; practise the habit of soliciting the bowels at the same time every day, and also never delay the call of nature in this respect; great derangement of the system and ill health, if not worse, may follow the neglect of this simple but necessarily healthful rule. Purgatives should not be indiscreetly used but rather avoided unless under medical advice; an injection of a teaspoonful of g^erine (Lever's) should be taken to procure a motion of the bowels, and small glass syringes may be bought cheaply at the chemist's fo? this especial purpose. Such injections will be found useful in overcoming this troublesome complaint. Consumption is too serious a matter for treatment here.

Convulsions.—Place the child in a hot bath—but not so' hot as to scald him.

A teaspoonful of castor oil should clear off the cause of irritation, while the stomach may be rubbed with a warm hand, and a hot linseed poultice or hot flannel applied. The child may be placed in a hot bath m severe cases or an enema of hot water given : a teaspoonful of dill-water also gives relief. Coughs.—Usually an accompaniment of some other com- plaint, as cold, bronchitis, &c. A chest protector (made bv cutting a slit in the middle of £ yard of narrow width flannel, and passing head through slit) is an excellent preventative and cure of coughs. When the lungs are affected the back needs protection as well as the chest. A mixture of equal C f6Ver 8t.gly(ieTe an? lemon iuice taken in teaspoon- ful doses from time to time is an excellent cure for a drv hacking cough.

Everything should be taken warm—nor or cold food will increase diarrhoea. Diphtheria attacks children more than grown-up people, and is especially dangerous to them. Medical assistance must be sought at once, and the patient isolated. The signs are sore throat with shooting pains, headache and fever. In bad cases white patches appear on throat and palate. These may form a thick, white, false skin, which will cause suffocation if the throat is not opened (tracheo- tomy). Diphtheria generally comes from bad drainage, and is fearfully contagious. The nurse should frequently gargle her throat with chlorate of potash and water (one ounce to a pint) and disinfect her hands with plenty of Lifebuoy Soap. A free supply of fresh air from constantly open win- dows forms one of the best chances of life to the patient. Earache.—Warm a small teaspoonful of glycerine (Lever's) by holding it in a spoon over a candle, pour gently into the ear, lay a pad of heated cotton-wool all over the ear and fasten on with a flannel bandage.

Inflammation of the Eyes.—A preparation of the ^American wych-hazel used in warm water will often be found an admirable lotion, reducing the imflammation and allaying pain. Gently syringing the eye with warm water will remove foreign bodies, or a camel's hair pencil may be used. Stye on the eye is really a little boil and should be poulticed with warm bread and water; the eye should be rested and protected from light by a shade. There are many affections of the eye and for all but the simplest the help ot a doctor should be sought. Indigestion.—Also called dyspepsia. Appears m many forms and from various causes. Sometimes excess of iood causes it; and sometimes an insufficiency of food, when the digestive organs become weakened. A frequent cause is msuni- cient mastication of food. Consequently, the great golden rule for avoiding indigestion is to masticate your food thoroughly. Eat slowly and reduce the food in your mouth to a complete pulp. A useful medicine is bi-carbonate of soda and water taken occasionally after meals, or bismuth, or charcoal lozen- ges • dilute hydro-chloric acid has been recommended; buy I few pennyworth and take 15 drops in a wineglass of water half an hour before meals, three times daily. This may be continued for a week, and the treatment then suspended for a few days. One or two teaspoonfuls of glycerine (Levers) oc- cJionally after meals is said to be very useful, .*nd sufferers from indigestion should sweeten their tea, coffee and food w?th glycerine instead of sugar.

The patient should lie between blankets and take hot barley- water, to which sweet spirit of nitre has been added in the> proportion of a dessert-spoonful of the spirit to a pint of barley water. No beer or meat should be taken—in fact, it is said that rheumatism is sometimes cured by simply ceasing to take beer. Derangement of the stomach often accompanies Lumbago, and Gregory's Powder, or black draught, assists a cure. Lungs, Inflamma=» tion of the.—A serious complaint, which if neg- lected may develop into consumption. The characteristics are feverishness, headache, shivering, cough, dryness of the skin, and a great feeling of oppression and pain in the chest. Appli- cation of hot linseed poul- tices and of hot flannels may afford relief, and medical aid should be sought at once. Inflam- mation of the lungs is also called Pneumonia; and inflammation of the serous membrane investing the lungs and the cavity of the thorax is called Pleurisy. Among the other principal diseases connected with the lungs are consumption and bronchitis. Similar symptoms, such as cough, pain in the side, and loss of flesh are noticeable, with sometimes spitting of blood and sometimes exhausting perspiration at night. For the night sweats Dover's Powder may be taken, but in all trouble with the lungs a doctor should be consulted. . Measles is caused by a poison in the blood.

Then about the fourth day a rash appears, usually first on the face, raised above the skin and running into half- moon shaped blotches; spreading downward it covers the body in twenty-four hours. It should be encouraged to come out; there is great danger in suppressing a rash; great care should be taken against chills, especially at night; and the room should be warm but well ventilated. The special danger to guard against is trouble with the lungs, and bronchitis and pneumonia may arise. There may also be diarrhoea, sickness, inflammation of the eyes and of the wind- pipe. The complaint is highly contagious, and Lifebuoy Soap should therefore be plentifully used, not only in wash- ing every vessel used by the sick person—generally, in the case of measles, a child; but the nurse should also wash her hands repeatedly with the Lifebuoy Soap, this latter precau- tion being her great source of safety. In all infectious diseases warm water, clean towel, nail brush, and Lifebuoy Soap should be kept outside the sick-room for the doctor's use. lniection continues in measles while any cough or shedding 01 skin remains—perhaps about four weeks.

Should deafness, or discharge from tho ear arise, consult a doctor. As this complaint is so infectious use LiFEiiuor Soap. Neuralgia.—Nerve pain. The term has come to he used to include pain of the- nerves, connecting the teeth or gums •with the brain. Neuralgia generally arises from cold, and also want of tone in the nervous system. A grain of quinine may be taken three or four times a day, and will often effect a cure. Some persons can take larger doses. The red cin- chona bark affords a useful and cheap tonic for those who cannot take quinine {see Influenza). Hot fomentations, such as sponges or hot flannels wrung out of boiling water may be applied to ease the pain. Neuralgic sufferers, it is said, need fat; if they cannot digest the fat of meat they should try cream, eggs, milk, cod-liver oil. Neuralgia often arises from bad teeth, and a dentist should be consulted. Paralysis.—Often follows apoplexy {which see). There is loss of feeling or power of motion in various parts of the body. Loss of power in one side of the body is called hemi- plegia, or, in the lower parts, paraplegia. There may be also local palsies. Paralysis may occur without an apoplectic attack, but there are usually premonitory signs, such as a torpor of the body, pain, or a feeling of weight in the head, aDd loss of memory. The complaint is too serious for household treatment, and a doctor must be consulted. Nux vomica (strychnine) is a powerful nervine tonic. Dr. Lankester prescribes one twenty-fourth of a grain as a dose, but it must be used very cautiously as it is poisonous. Piles (also Called Hemorrhoids).— Painful tumours, situated inside and sometimes outside the opening of the lower bowel. In certain cases they bleed frequently and the patient becomes much weakened. They are often caused by consti- pation, too sedentary a life, or sitting on cold stones or wet seats. Avoid indigestible food and alcoholic drinks, eat plenty of ripe fruit; baked apples are very useful.

Sweets, acids, beer, and much meat should be avoided—rheumatism is often cured simply by refraining from beer. Pure glycerine, such as Lever's, may be used for sweetening instead of sugar. The patient must remain in bed and be dieted on gruel, milk and water, barley water, &c, while hot fomentations may be applied. Flannel underclothing should be worn night and day; and the affected parts may be rubbed with chloroform liniment, mustard oil, methylated spirit, or paraffin oil. Warm baths may also be taken with advantage. Ringworm and Shingles.—Kings or patches of small vesicles which appear on the head and itch considerably. "Ringworm" on the waist, appearing in clusters of inflamed patches, and circling the body like a belt, is called shingles. Ringworm is very infectious, and the child suffering from it ishould be strictly kept from others. Dissolve a piece of washing soda, the size of your fist, in j ust sufficient water to melt it; .cut the hair away from the affected part, and dab on the soda two or three times a day, taking care it does not trickle down. Keep a cap on the head. The patient should have plenty of wholesome, nourishing food, cod.-liver oil, and sea air if possible. Tobacco-water and ink should never be used. Absolute cleanliness is essential, and the patient's towels, brush and comb, &c, should never be used by others. Plenty of Lifebuoy Soap may be used to guard against infection. Scarlet Fever.—Sometimes an attack begins with sick- ness (vomiting); there is shivering, sore throat, feverishness, hot, dry skin, and headache; an eruption appears on the skin like scarlet dots closely set, "but is not raised on the skin (see Measles); this rash affects the body more than the face. The eruption is at its height usually on the fourth or fifth day, and the throat trouble is then generally at its worst. Hot linseed poultices may be applied to the throat, and ice given to the patient to suck at the same time. The skin may be anointed with Eucalyptus oil to allay the great irritation, and help to prevent the spread of infection. Good ventilation of the bedroom in infectious illness is most essential, especially so in the case of scarlet fever and diphtheria. The patient SUNLIGHT SOAP, largest sale in the world. 0383 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. must, of course, be kept in bed ; the diet must be very care- fully regulated and consist of "slops," such as milk, gruel,' beef tea, lemonade, &c.; the room must be kept scrupulously clean. On the eighth day the eruption has generally so far? faded as to be scarcely recognisable. The peeling of the skin then commences and shreds off from the whole of the body in large flakes. This "desquamation" of the skin is most important and the patient must be regarded as an invalid until it is over. Sometimes the process occupies four or five weeks, though, by suitable means, it may be hastened. Lifebuoy Soap is now most valuable—perhaps in no disease is it more valuable ; as soon as the doctor permits a bath, the patient should be freely lathered with the Lifebuoy Soap and, hot water. It does good to the skin and, disinfects the particles that peel off in flakes. S ick=Headache (Megrim). — A good remedy is said to be half .a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda in, a wine-glass of water; or two tumblers of mustard and water drunk quickly; this is an emetic, and clears the stomach and stops nausea. While it lasts starvation is the best plan; but sometimes neuralgic symptoms arise. Some persons find great benefit from a cup of strong tea or coffee, which should be thoroughly well made, brisk, not flat, and of good quality. Sore Throat.—Hot salt may be applied in a flannel bag/ while a useful gargle is made with an ounce of chlorate of potash dissolved in a pint of boiling water and used hot or cold; gargle frequently. Relaxed sore throat indicates general debility, and a good tonic should be taken, also plenty of wholesome, digestible, and nourishing food. Don't worry! Use SUNLIGHT SOAP.389 THE HOUSEHOLD DOCTOR. Toothache.—"When arising solely from a hollow tooth, 'toothache may be cured by a few drops of chloroform on a piece of cotton wool pressed into the cavity, or a paste may be made of cayenne pepper and brandy or whiskey and pressed into the hollow. Quinine may be taken as an internal remedy, and the tooth should be* stopped by a competent dentist. The proper care of the teeth is most important. Children should early be taught the effective use of the tooth-brush, and nothing is better for cleaning the teeth than soap. Rub a soft tooth-brush over a piece of Sunlight Soap, and then thoroughly brush the teeth on both sides, night and morning, both on retiring to rest and on rising. Tartar should never form on them with this treatment; but if it should have formed before the continued use of soap, a little powdered cuttle-fish bone may be permitted. Skin Diseases.—The skin is one of the vital organs; myriads of pores pierce it everywhere. Through them the blood "breathes" as it were and absorbs the purifying oxygen and the life-giving light, but the pores also carry off dele- terious matter, being connected with glands which separate impurities from the blood. If, then, the pores be closed by uncleanliness or by the constriction of cold, the constitution suffers ; the work of the skin is thrown on other organs, and they, having too much to do are likely to give way under the strain. Hence the immense value of cleanliness. Use plenty of Sunlight Soap which is a pure and cleansing soap. Small Pox.—Probably the most contagious disease to which mankind is subject. Send for a doctor at once, or remove to a good hospital. Keep the room as well ventilated as possible; use plenty of Lifebuoy Soap (see special use of Lifebuoy Soap further on), and smear the eruption with bacon fat daily, when it is well out; the fat prevents pitting and allays irritation; also sponge patient with tepid water, as it soothes the sufferer and aids convalescence. But never permit the patient to feel chilly. After the pustules have burst, still continue the sponging and dust powdered starch over them to absorb the discharge. We cannot too strongly insist on the importance of absolute cleanliness, thorough ventilation with- out subjecting the patient to chilliness or draughts, and the SUNLIGHT SOAP is worth its weight in gold."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 390 immediate removal of all dirty linon or any woollen or cotton garments that the patient may have worn. Whooping Cough.—Commences like an ordinary cold or cough and after a few days the whooping (or backdraw as it is sometimes called) is heard following a fit of coughing ; or there may he little or no whooping ; often there is sickness. During the whooping stage, the patient should he kept indoors, except in sultry weather, and every precaution should he taken against the sufferer contracting bronchitis or pneumonia. The rooms therefore, while well ventilated, must he free from draught. A muslin curtain should be thrown over the bed at night and a piece of flannel may be swathed round the abdomen. A liniment made of one teaspoonf ul of oil of cloves, two teaspoonfuls of oil of amber, and two table- spoonfuls of camphorated oil well shaken up together in a bottle, should be rubbed into the pit of of the stomach and into the spine every night. Attention to diet is of great importance, the best food being broth, milk, eggs, curds-and- whey and barley water. In severe cases, some carbolic acid may be poured on a red hot shovel; the fumes in the air are believed to have the same effect as taking the patient to gas works, carbolic acid being one of the coal-tar products. Infection remains while the cough continues, and it^ may remain for months. Paroxysms are induced by violent exercise and screaming, and in some cases a child may vomit all its food. For such cases a doctor should be consulted, and in some instances complete change of air is necessary to ensure recovery. Wounds.—Injuries to the flesh, when the skin is broken are known as wounds. Prompt treatment is necessary, the first step being to stop the bleeding. Care should be taken to remove all dirt or Hair from the wound, and if any artery be ruptured, it must be tied by a thread of silk. If the bleeding be profuse, a handkerchief should be tied tightly above the injured part and a small rod passed beneath the handkerchief and turned round so as to constrict the limb as tightly as possible and press the arteries against the bone, and thus prevent the flow of blood through them. This may check the bleeding until a surgeon comes. _ As a rule the best plan, directly a wound has been caused, is to press No wear and tearTHE HOUSEHOLD DOCTOR. 39* where SUNLIGHT SOAP is used. the edges together and immediately tie it tightly with cold water bandages or a piece of linen rag, or of lint soaked in a preparation of the American wych-hazel. This lotion possesses the property in a marked degree 01 stopping bleeding and preventing inflammation. When the bandages are removed and it is found they adhere to the wound, they should be moistened with tepid water to loosen the adhesive- ness and enable them to be taken away without re-opening the edges, or disturbing the healing process. "When the bleeding has stopped, the edges of the wound may be kept in their places by adhesive plaster, or it may be necessary to sew the edges together with fine silk, or silver thread. If the injuries are severe the parts must have perfect rest, and the patient must remain in bed for a short time. How to give Medicine. Weights and Measures of Medicine. 2 pints equal to one quart. 4 quarts „ to one gallon. One tablespoonful is equal to half an ounce. 20 ounces equal to one pint. Euxes for Giving Medicine. . 1. Before giving medicine the label on the bottle should always be read. ■ 2. Never give medicine to sick people without the doctor's orders. 3. Never substitute some of your own choosing for that which the doctor has ordered. 4 Always ask the doctor: (1) If the medicine is to be taken before or after meals ? (2) If the patient is to be roused from sleep to take it ? (3) If it is to be given through the night? (4) If it is to be continued after the first bottle is finished? (5) If any special precautions are to be taken against catching cold, as some few medicines predispose to cold ? 5. Always keep the medicine bottle in a place by itself, not mixed up with liniments and other bottles that contain perhaps, poisons. 6. Always give medicine punctually.392 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. When SUNLIGHT SOAP is used 7. Always be sure to note if the medicine lias Lad the effect it is intended to have. It is very important to be able to tell the doctor whether the medicine has had the desired effect or not. 8. Never give children the medicine ordered for grown up people. Never give opium or laudanum to a baby. One drop of laudanum has been known to kill a laby. 9. Never give medicines or prescriptions that have done good in some cases, to other patients that appear to be suffering from the same symptoms. 10. Occasionally, medicines contain strong poisons; after a time people taking such become able to take a larger dose ■without harm, and the quantity taken may be increased by the doctor ; but when such medicine is left off it should not be resumed without medical leave. A Special Use of Lifebuoy Soap. In infectious cases every utensil used by the sick person should be frequently washed -with Lifebuoy Soap, also the hands of the nurse—this is her great source of safety. There shouldalways be a table outside thesick-room with warm water, clean towel, nail-brush, and a piece of Lifebuoy Soap ready for the doctor to wash his hands after his visit. The infected room is better without any carpets ; if it has any small strips they should be burned afterwards. There should be no up- holstered furniture. Curtains should be of dimity, which can be boiled. Table-covers, antimacassars, and all articles not actually needed should be banished. There must be no coming and going between the sick-room and the rest of the house. All crockery, tea cloths, glasses, &c., required should be brought up at the beginning of the illness, and should not go down again. All food and drink which has to be brought up daily, should be received in vessels put at the top of the stairs ready for them. A bath or pail should stand on the landing, with a lather of Lifebuoy Soap and water, (best made with hot water), all clothing of nurse or patient should be placed in this for some hours before it_ is removed to be washed and boiled. A large sheet soaked in the same and hung before the sick-room door, up to the ceiling, and down to the ground, is a means of intercepting and destrojing the disease germs from the sick-room.LEVER'S PURE DOUBLE DISTILLED GLYCERINE. "The applications of Glycerine are endless," says that well-known authority on Therapeutics, Dr. Sydney Binger« It is an antiseptic (that is, it preserves from putrefaction), healing, emollient, nutrient, and acts with remarkable efficacy m a large number of ailments. Being perfectly harmless {when perfectly pure) it is an excellent and safe household remedy, the use of which will save many doctor's and druggist's bills. Therefore every mother of a family should keep a supply at hand, most especially in country places where " safe and simple" home remedies, applied quickly, save much pain, and very often life also. The chief thing to remember in the use of Glycerine is the absolute importance of obtaining it pure. Many impure glycerines are made, adultered with injurious compounds. These may do a great deal of harm. How then are we to guard ourselves against these ? Yery easily. The British Pharmacopoeia has instituted a number of tests by which the purity of Glycerine can be ascertained. A Glycerine which will not stand one, but all these tests cannot possibly fail to be perfectly reliable. The Glycerine manufactured by LEVER BROTHERS, LIMITED, is guaranteed to stand all these tests, and it can therefore be recommended for all household purposes. A West End Physician, writing on January 29th, 1897, says^ "T find the Glycerine of most excellent quality ior internal use, having taken it myself. It is everything I can wish : I have therefore recommended it." The Young Ladies' Journal for March 20th, 1897, gives the following reply to one of its correspondents :— the home is always bright." MiRA.KDA.~Try a few drops of warm Glycerine in your ear; be most careful that it is not too warm, and be sure that it is of good quality. You can rely upon the quality of LEVER'S GLYCERINE." There are a few uses for Glycerine, other than medical, which it is well for all household managers to know :— TO PREVENT FROSTY AND STEAMY WIN- DOWS.—Clean the windows thoroughly, and apply LEVER'S GLYCERINE all over the surface; polish this lightly with a dry cloth until quite dry. Don't rub hard, but lightly, so that the Glycerine is rubbed in. The windows will then keep clean for weeks without getting frosty or steamy. This knowledge will be most valuable, as it is advisable that windows should be bright if goods are to be shown to best advantage. By not requiring cleaning too frequently, this method will also prove a great boon to householders in winter, as it is well known that glass frequently cracks if cleaned in a hard frost. TO PRESERVE EGGS NEW LAID FOR MONTHS.—Smear the shells the same day as the eggs are laid, with LEVELS GLYCERINE. They will be milky and as fresh as if just laid at the end of many weeks. They need not be packed in any special way, but kept as most convenient, but it is best to keep the smaU end up. LEVER'S GLYCERINE answers much better than butter or grease for this purpose, as it will never turn rancid as these do, and thereby spoil the flavour of the egg. It is most important to use LEVER'S GLYCERINE for this purpose as it is guaranteed to be absolutely pure. FOR SWEETENING PURPOSES—LEVER'S GLYCERINE may be used to sweeten tea, coffee, etc., when sugar disagrees. It has just the opposite tendency of sugar—it prevents acidity and fermentation instead of increasing it. A friend in need is a friend indeed—BIRTHS, MARRIAGES "AND DEATHS. 395 IBirtbs, flDarriages anb Beatbs, ENGLAND AND WALES. Birth*.—Judging from the Registrar-General's [Returns for 1895—the last complete Returns available—there "were slightly fewer persons born in England and Wales in that year than the average for the preceding ten years. That is to say, they were equal to a rate of 30-4 per 1,000 persons living, or 0-8 below the average rate for the preceding ten years. The lowest rate was in Sussex, viz., 24-3, and in Surrey, West- moreland, Huntingdonshire, Rutlandshire and Devonshire the rate was almost equally low; the counties with highest birth rates were Durham, with 35-8; Staffordshire, 35 6; Mon- mouthshire, 35*0 ; South Wales, 34-9 ; Nottinghamshire, 33-4 ; and Derbyshire, 33-0. The number of boys born' was 468,886, and girls 453,405c But the excess of boys over girls has shown a tendency to decline ever since 1841. The children registered as born out of wedlock were 38,836, and were in the proportion of 42 per 1,000, i.e., out of every 1,000 children born, 42 were born illegitimate. This is about the lowest on record. Marriages.—The number registered was 228,204, which was a slight fall as compared with that of 1894. Judging from the increase in Jewish marriages it appears that the number of Jews living in this country has increased, Re-marriage, i.e., marriages of widowers and widows, were the lowest on record. A large number of persons still seem unable to write, for 40 out of every 1,000 men signed the marriage register with marks instead of with their names, and similarly illiterate women were 48 out of every 1,000. Twenty-nine marriagea took place by special license. Deaths.—The deaths registered in 1895 numbered 568,997, an increase of 2-1 per 1,000 on the very low rate of 1894, but slightly lower than the average of the ten preceding years. The rate in 1895 was 18-7 per 1,000 of the population, whereas in 1894 the rate was 16-6 per 1,000 of the population. 0! the deaths, 290,704 were males and 278,293 were females.

The rate in fact was higher in 1895 than in any year since 1847, when it was 164 per 1,000. SCOTLAND. f Births.—The number registered was 126,454, which was a birth rate of 3*04 per cent., or 304 in every ten thousand of the population. Of these 64,815 were boys, and 61,639 girls. Of thextotal, 9,146 were illegitimate, equal to a percentage of 7*23 per cent. This rate varied, being 9-6 per cent, in the Mainland-rural districts, and 6-0 per cent, in the Insular- rural districts. The total number of births show slight increase as compared with the previous years. The number of births over deaths is 44,590. ' Marriages.—The number registered was 28,380, or 68 to every ten thousand of the estimated population—a slight increase as compared with the previous year. ' Deaths.—Of these 81,864 were registered, showing a death rate of 1*97 per cent., or 197 in every ten thousand persons. Persons of the male sex dying were 40,726 ; female, 41,138. These numbers again show a slight increase over the previous year. RE LAND. Births.—During the year 106,113 births were registered; 54,658 boys, and 5J,455 girls. These figures give the birth rate at 23-2 per thousand, which is 0-3 over the average per thousand for the past ten years. In other words there was a slight increase in the number of births; 2,871 births regis- tered were illegitimate; i.e., 2-7 per cent, of the whole, the same average appearing for the preceding ten years. Marriages.—-The number registered, 23,120, shows a rate of 5-05 per thousand of the estimated population; a slight increase (-35) over Cat of the previous year, and (-59) above the average for the previous ten years. Of these marriages 15,938 were between Eoman Catholics; 3,817 according to the rites of the Ohurchof Ireland (of these 52 were by special license); 2,461 in Presbyterian churches; 489 in " registered buildings of various denominations; 400 by civil contract m registrar's offices; 10 Society of Friends (Quakers); and 5 According to Jewish rites.

The 18-4 death-rate is slightly above (0-2) the average for the preceding ten years. The four counties having the lowest registered mortality are Sligo, 12-4 per 1,000; Kerry, 12-9 ; Eoscommon, 13-0 ; and Mayo, 13-2. Dublin was the highest with 26*2, and Antrim, next with 23-0.

ATHLETICS.—The year 1896 will long be remembered by reason' of the sudden and vigorous action taken by the Amateur Athletic Association against a number of the best men of the day, who had been proved guilty of asking and receiving expenses for competing at sports. Just before the decision of the Championships they suspended C. A. Bradley (100 yards champion and record holder), A. B. Downer (Scottish champion and record holder), F. E. Bacon (mile champion and record holder), G. Crossland (10 miles champion, winner of Northern and National Cross-Country Championships and record holler), and H. Watkins (Southern Counties Cross Country ex- Champion. Naturally this step gave rise to much discussion, but it is noteworthy that, sooner or later, each of these men has now joined the professional ranks ; and as their action has been followed by several other prominent ex-amateurs, professional running has largely benefited in consequence. Of course, with such men away and other champions either not competing or out of foriii, the Amateur Athletic Championships, held at Northampton on July 4th, had a very open appearance, though the quality of the performances suffered in most cases, a result greatly aided by the strong wind. Only three holders retained their titles. Godfrey Shaw, L.A.C,, won the Hurdles in 15f sec, with the wind behind him, which prevented his time being accepted as record. D. Horgan won the "Weight Putting with 43 ft. 5£ in., and W. J. Sturgess broke the record in the 4 miles walk, doing the distance in 28 min. 57§ sec. The remaining events resulted as follows:—100 yards, N. D. Morgan (Champion 1890) (lOf sec.); Quarter- mile, J. C. Meredith, Dublin University (52 sec.) j Half-mile, Lieut. W. A. de C. King, Royal Engineers and L.A.C. (2 min. U sec.) ; Mile, B. Lawford, S.L.H. (4 min. 314 sec.); Four Miles, H. Harrison, Manchester H. (20 min. 27f sec.); Two Miles Steeplechase, S. J. Robinson, Northampton A.A.C. (11 min. 25 sec.); Long Jump, C. E. H. Leggatt, United Hospitals and L.A.C. (23 ft. f in.); High Jnmp, M. O'Brien, Gaelic A.A. (5 ft. 11 in.) ; Throwing the Hammer, J. Flanagan, Gaelic A.A. (131 ft, 11 in.). Later in the month, A. G. Butler (United Hospitals and L.A.C.) beat the Half-mile Champion m the L.A.C. and United Hospitals Match, doing the distance just inside two minutes. But, as in the previous year, the most notable performances were accomplished by walkers. Thus, on September 26th, 1896, W. J. Sturgess, in a match with D. Fenton, broke the mile record, doing the distance in 6 min. 33f sec, while a week later (October 3rd), in a 15 miles handicap, he made new records from 9 to 14 miles inclusive, retiring after finishing the latter distance in 1 hr. 52 mm. 59$ Bee.

Among the most notable Cross-Country events may be mentioned the double breaking of the record for the Cambridge U.H. and H course by J. G. Gibb (Old Citizens), and W. W. Gibberd (C.U.H and H.), in a match between the C.U.H. and H. and O.C.H. and H. on November 28th. Gibb did 39 min. 9 sac. and Gibberd 39 min. 33 sec. as against S. H. VVhateley's 40 min. 10 sec. in 1884. On the following Friday Cambridge again won the Inter-'Varsity Cross-Country Eace by 20 points to 35, Gibberd covering the 7£ miles of very heavy going in 47 min. 11 sec. The race was for the first time held over a neutral course at Roeharnpton. The Cross-Country Championships resulted as follows:— Northern Counties (Crewe Hall Park, February 20th, 1897).

On April 10th a Walk from London to Brighton, promoted by the Polytechnic Harriers, was won by E. Knott, who covered the distance from Regent Street to the Brighton Aquarium (54 miles) in the wonderful time of 9 hrs. 10 min. 14 sec.: that from Westminster in 8 hrs 56 min. 44 sec, the latter time being 28 min. 44 sec. faster than was taken by the late J.

BOXING.—The Amateur Championships were held at St. James'a Hall, London, on April 10th, 1897. Four out of the five holders did not defend their titles, and the display was generally considered a poor one. Eesults :—Bantam weights—C. T. Lamb. Feather weights—N. F. Smith. Light weights—A. Vanderhout (holder). Middle weights—W. Dees. Heavy weights—" B. Haverdale " (G. L. Townsend). BILLIARDS.—Comparatively little of interest has taken place during the past season. John Roberts is still able to give any other player starts from 7,000 to 9,000 in a 24,000 spot-barred game, while the chance of his meeting Peall in an all-in match seems as remote as ever. At the end of February and the beginning of Apiil last, Roberta attempted to give the latter player the enormous start of 12,000 out of 24,000, but failed on each occasion, scoring 23,690 and 23.370 respec- tively. Both games, which were in? £500 a side, were, however, great successes, the progress of them being watched by large audiencea.

The biggest all-in. break is 3,304 (93, 3, 150, 123, 172, and 400 spots), made by W. J. Peall* at the Westminster Aquarium, Nov. 4-6, 1880. The biggest spot- barred breaks are 1,467, made by T. Taylor at the Aquarium on Aprili 24th, 1891; but on this occasion he got the balls jammed in the leffci top corner pocket, and scored a sequence of 729 cannons while they, were in that position.

CRICKET.—The 1896 season was again ore of particular interest, both by reason of the visit of another Australian team (the ninth) and on account of the splendid struggle for county championship honours. Although the Australians lost two out of the three international games, the team was, without doubt, the most successful that ever visited us, as is proved by the record of the tour, which reads— 34 matches played, 19 won, 6 lost, 9 drawn. The three international matches were of a most interesting nature. The first, the Australians (who made 53, and 347) lost by 6 wickets. In the second they scored a first innings of 412 against 231 by England. Then in England's second innings, K. S. Eanjitsinhji came to the rescue with a splendid innings of 154. Ultimately the visitors were left to get 125 to win, but bo well did Eichardson bowl, that 7 wickets were lost before fhey accomplished the task. England's first innings in the deciding match realised only 145; but although the first Australian wicket put on 75 runs, the whole side was out for 119— 26 runs behind. Then England went in—and out—for 84, leaving the Australians 111 to get. But Peel and Hearne rose to the occasion, and an exciting match ended in a victory for England by 66 runs. The honours of the year, as regards batting, were Garried off by K S. Eanjitsinhji, whose total of 2,780 runs is the highest ever obtained in one season, W. G. Grace coming next with 2,739, made in 1871. J. T. Hearne and Eichardson were equally distinguished as bowlers. Principal Amateur and Professional Averages, 1896. Batting Eanjitsinhji, K.

For one thing the " unlicensed amateur " became a creature of the past, chang- ing into an avowed professional now that he saw money to be made in the new departure. Then too, nearly every amateur good enough was induoed to turn professional, and to ride in the interests of one or another of the big cycle and tire companies. Naturally, under such conditions, and with every assistance that can be supplied in the way of skilfully controlled pacing by multicycles, records are being made and beaten almost daily; while amateur racing, though undoubtedly purer than before, has necessarily deteriorated in quality. In the circumstances, we shall content ourselves with giving a few of the more notable performances of 1896-7 and a selection of the most interesting records. But quite apart from the racing cyclists and those interested in their doings, the machine has achieved an almost inconceivable popularity among people who use it feolely as a means of healthful exercise, and for touring from place to place. To these, probably the most numerous section of riders, we trust that the accompanying specially prepared maps will prove of service. On May 30th, 1896, the First Portion of the N.C.U. Championships took place at the Wood Green track, the times of the various races being very slow, since pacing was not permitted. The One Mile Amateur Championship was won by P. W. Brown (Polytechnic CO) in 3 min. 23 sec, while M. Diakoff, a Eussian member of the Catford C.C. secured the 25 miles Amateur Championship in 1 hr. 5 min. 15 sec. Five Miles Professional Championship falling to J. Green (of North- umberland). On June 6th a series of professional races took place at Catford, ostensibly to decide the comparative merits of the Simpson Lever Chain and the one invented by McCabe. The former won two out of the three events decided. C. F. Barden, (McCabe) beat J Michael (Simpson) in the 5 mile race in 10 min. 40£ sec. T. Lintoi (Simpson) beat J.W. Stocks in the One Hour race, doing 29 miles 643 yds. in the time. The 50 miles race was won by C. Huret (Simpson"), who beat A. A. Chase (McCabe), and made (then) world's record from 32 miles onwards, covering the full distance in 1 hr. 42 min. 42 1-5 sec. The Second Portion of the N.C.U. Championships was decided at Newport (Mon.) on June 20th, a high wind materially affecting the times. A. Macferson, of Blackpool, won the Quarter Mile Amateur Champion- ship in 33* sec, M. Diakoff adding the Five Miles Amateur Cham- pionship (14 min. 561 sec) to his previous success. The Professional Mile Championship was secured by C. F Barden in 2 mm. 30$ sec., while J. Green (Northumberland) emulated Diakoff by winning the Professional Quarter Mile in 334 sec. Finally, later m the year, W. H. Bardsley won the 50 Miles Amateur Championship in 1 hi. 57 min. 28| sec. The International 'Varsity Match, which took place at Wood Green on June 26th, resulted in an easy win for Cambridge which scored most points in each of the three races (1, 4, and 10 milep). The Century Cop (amateurs) was won by B. Palmer (SilverdaleSPORTS AND PASTIMES. C.C.) on June 27th, all the then records from 75 miles being beaten, and the full distance covered in 3 hr. 47 min. 47$ sec. The Catford Gold Vask (professionals) was won by J. W. Stocks on July 9—11, with a total score of 302 miles 176 yards for the three days' ride of 12 hours per day. The Cxtca Cup 24 Hours' Eacb (amateur) decided at Heme Hill on July 24th, 1896, was won by F. R. Goodwin with the new amateur record of 476 miles 1702 yds., a professional race of the same distance, decided simultaneously at Wood Green, falling to C. Huret, who, after riding 288 miles 240 yds. in 12 hours (record), and finding his opponents beaten, slowed down, and contented him- self with 460 miles. About this time A. V. Linton succumbed to an illness mainly caused by his over-exertion in the Bordeaux-Paris race on May 25th. More records were made by E. Palmer in the Bath Eoad 100 Miles Challenge Cup Eace at Catford on August 8th,: the full distance occupying 3 hrs. 37 min. 57£ eec. The World's Championships at Copenhagen, on August 15th, resulted as follows:— Hi M> s° 1 mile (ama.) H. Eevnolds 1 mile (pro.) M. Bourillon .... 100 kilom. (ama.). .. M. Ponscarme 100 kilom. (pro.) .. A. A. Chase latter match between Reynolds and Bourillon was won by the At the Surrey Bicycle Club Autumn Meeting held at Kennineton Oval on September 12th, H. S. Large won both the half-mile race for ttte bYDNEY Challenge Trophy and the ten miles race for the Surrey Challenge Cup. E. J. Callaghan tried hard to emulate this feat at the following Spring Meeting on April 3rd, 1897, but though he secured toe Surrey Cup, he was just beaten by J. Mc W. Bourke in the bYDNEY Trophy Eace. Since then the close competition between these two riders m the various short distance scratch races has been one of the features of the racing during 1897. Up to the time of writing £«5*? ?0ILthe maJ'ority of them, but in each case Callaghan had been defeated after extremely close finishes.

How greatly this has now extended may be judged from the fact that the-Association Cup Final Tie attracted no fewer than 65,000 spectators—easily beating all previous records for attendances at athletic meetings of any kind. Association.—The above-mentioned tie, which was decided at the Crystal Palace on April 10th, 1897, practically finished the season. The teams left in were Aston Villa and Everton, the former of which, after an exciting and well-contested game throughout, succeeded in winning by 3 goals to 2.

Sooth match (played Dec. 12, 1896) was won by the Southihy a try (3 points) to nil. Oxford won the Inteb- 'Vabsity match on December by 9 points (a dropped goal and a goal from a try) to 8 points, (a goal and a try). The Intebnational Matches resulted as follows:— Wales b.

The remaining matches were not played on account of the dispute with the Welsh Kugby Union, arising out of the testimonial to Mr, A. J. Gould. ? GOLF.—The Open Championship, played at Muirfield in 1896, *esultedin H. Vardon, the Scarborough professional, beating J. H. Taylor, of Winchester, the former holder, by 4 strokes, the scores being Vardon 157; Taylor 161. But since in an exhibition match between Hie Champion and his brother Tom Vardon, played on March 27th, 1897, the latter won by 144 strokes to 150, the contest for the 1897 championship appears at the time of writing to be a very open one. The Champions during the past five years have been :— 1892. Mr. Harold H. Hilton, played at Muirfield (score 305). 1893. W. Auchterlonie, played at Prestwich (score 322), 1894. 5. II. Taylor, played at Sanction (score 326). 1895. 3. H, Taylor, played at St. Andrew's (score 322). 1896. H. Vardon, play:-d tit Muirfield (score 157). In thase years the conditions of play were altered, four rounds being played insteid of two. The Amateub Championship, also decided at Muirfield on April 30th, 1897, was won by Mr. A. J. T. Allan, who beat in tbe final Mr. J. Kobb. The Championships have resulted as follows :— 1887. Horace Hutchinson b. Jno. Ball, jun. 1888. Jno. Ball, jun. b. J. E.

LACROSSE.—The annual North and South meeting took place at Bichmond on April 10th, 1897, and again resulted in a fairly easy victory for the North by 11 goals to 7, this maki-ng their sixth suc- cessive win. The South op England Senior Flags fell to West London, who on March 13th, 1897, beat Snaresbrook by 15 goals to 2. The North op England Senior Flags were retained by Stockport (the holders) who on March 27th, 1897, beat Albert Park and Didsbury by 2 goals to 1. At the end of March a team from the Crescent Athletic Club, of Brooklyn, came over and were fairly successful in a series of matches played against some of our leading clubs and combinations. LAWN TENNIS.—The All-England Lawn Tennis Club Cham- pionships of 1896 resulted as follows :—Gentlemen's Singles, H. SJ Mahony ; Ladies' Singles, Miss C. Cooper (Champion 1895); Gentle- men's Doubles, W. and H. Baddeley (Champions 1895). The 1897 Beason commenced with the 8th Annual Covered Court Championships, played for at the beginning of April. In the Gentlemen's Singles, W. V. Eaves avenged his last year's defeat by beating the holder, E.' W. Lewis. The Gentlemen's Doubles also resulted in a change the previous holders, W. H. Eaves and C.

Indeed, it was at one time believed that an additional day's racing would be needed; but withdrawals and non- arrivals at the last moment enabled the programme to be got through in the usual period. Unfortunately, rain on the first afternoon and strong winds on the following days materially interfered with tha success of the meeting from a racing point of view, tbough the atten- dance left nothing to be desired. Great interest was taken in the entry of a crew from Yale College for the Grand Challenge Cup ; but the !Americans were beaten in their trial heat by Leander, who, after disposing of New College, succeeded in winning the trophy. Eton College again won the Ladies' Challenge Plate ; the brothers Nickalla (L R.C.) carried off the Stewards' Challenge Fours, and were equally successful in the raoe for the Silver Goblets (to which the Nickalls Challenge Cup is now added). The Wteold Challenge Cup fell to Trinity College, Oxford, While the Visitors' Challenge Cup was secured by Oaius College, Cambridge. The Diamond Challenge Sculls were easily retained by the holder, the Hon. R. Guinness (Leander R.C.), and the Thames Challenge Cup was won by Trinity College, Oxford. In the contest for the Wingfield Sculls, rowed over the Thames Cham- pionship course on July 17th, the Hon. R. Guinness succeeded m taming the tables on hia previous year's conqueror, V. Nickalls, after a good race. The winner, aa well aa his brother, the Hon. E. A. Guinness, were afterwards very successful in many of the subsequent regattas. In October, 1896, by way of variety to the attempts rnade by foreigiiers to conquWour champions, R. P. Croft (Thames and Trinity Hall R.O.) defeated F. Boudin for the Amateue Championship or Fr *clThe chief professional races of importance were the matches foi the World a Championship between Harding and Stanbmy and Stanbury and Gaudaur The former, in which the stake was £500 a-side, took place o^er the Thames Championship Course on July 13th, 1896, and waa won easily by Stanbury, who led from the start. Immediately after a match fJom Putney to Mortlake was arranged between Stanbury and Gaudaur for £250 a-side, the date fixed being September th, 189b.

In September, however, the champion's victorious career was temporarily checked by a sentence of suspension to the end of the year, in consequence of strong language alleged to have been used by him at a certain gala. Before then he had again retained the various Amateub Championships, which he won as follows: On June 11th, at Burslem, the 100 Yards in 61* sec. (record).

For once in a way lyers did not compete, on account of the roughness of the sea and the race was won by W. Green, of Liverpool, in 2 hrs. 33 min lb sec. But at Walsall, on September 2nd, Tyers and Derbyshire were found in their usual positions in the Five Hundred Yards Championship, which Tyers secured in 6 min. 554 sec. On March l7*^1!?7; atWooUoomooIoo Bay (N.S.W.), P. Cavill won the New South Wales Half Mile Championship in 12 min. 45* sec, the fastest amateur time on record. As it is probable at the time of writing that he will oppose Tyers for the championships, there is every likelihood of the 1897 season being distinguished by some notable performances m the way of record-breaking.

TURF.—As the hero of the 1895 season was Lord Rosebery, who with Sir Visto secured his second successive Derby, so was the follow- ing undoubtedly the Prince of Wales' year. But the Prince far eclipsed the Premier: for not only did Persimmon capture both the Dekby and the St. Legeb, but the One Thousand Guineas fell to H.R.H. filly Thais, who just missed securing the Oaks as well, in Which race, though she started a hot favourite, she could only finish second to Lord Derby's Canterbury Pilgrim.

St. Frusquin also carried off the Eclipse Stakes, for which Regret was second, and Troon third; so that it may be said that he and Persimmon were the two most successful horses of the year. The 1897 season opened with the Lincolnshire Handicap, won on March 23rd by the favourite, Wink6e!d's Pride, Funny Boat being second, and Bridegroom third. Another favourite, Manifesto, won- the Liverpool Grand National, Filbert (a 100 to 1 chance) being second, and Ford of Fyne third. On the following d z the Liverpool Spring Cup was won by Green Lawn, from St. Jar ath and Amphi-1 damas. The Northamptonshire Stares fell to Telescope, Posterity being second, and Ampbidamas again third. At the Epsom Spring- Meeting, the Great Metropolitan was won by Soliman, from Glentilt and Hattie, the City and Suburban being secured by Balsamo, who- was followed by Bay Roe aid and La Sagesse. The Two Thousand Guineas was won by Galtee More, Velasquez being second, and Minstrel third. The winner of the One Thousand Guineas was Chelandry, Galatia second, and Goletta third. The Chester Cup- was captured by Count Schomberg, who won from Piety and Shaddock. The Kempton Park Jubilee Stakes fell to Clwyd, who was followed by Kilcock and Victor Wild. Galtee More won the Newmarket Stakes, Berzak being second, and Frisson third. The Great Northern Handicap was secured by Laughing Girl, from "Unseen and Dolls, while the Somersetshire Stakes fell to Tender and True, Gribou being second, and Daublet third. For the Derby Galtee More was a warm favourite, and justified'his position by an easy two lengths win. But for the Oaks the favourite, Chelandry, who started at 5 to 2 on, was beaten by three lengths by Limasol (a 100 to 8 chance); Fortalice-^ was third, four lengths further behind.

B. Walker's Ailsa. The latter out of 49 raceB won 13 first and 11 second prizes, of a total value of £1,045. The Meteor started 22 times, winning 13 first and 4 seconds, the value of which totalled £1,480, while the Britannia won £1,022 worth of prizes (11 firsts and 4 seconds) in 45 races. Unfortunately a • sad accident Bpoilt the success of the season, the Meteor accidentally running down the Isolde, the owner of which, Baron voa Zedtwitz, was killed through the collision. Strangely enough, another Isolde, the pro- perty of Mr. P. Donaldson, was the most successful among the second- class yachta, winning 35 prizes, the value of which amounted to £1,025. Then came Mr. F. W. L. Popham's Corsair, 14 prizes, value £480. The 1897 season was opeaed by both Britannia and Ailsa in fina style.

Dumb Crambo.—The company divide into two parties; one leaves the room ; the other chooses a simple word which has several rhymes to it, as " dance." The other party are then called in and told that a word has been chosen rhy- ming to "lance;" the others have then to guess the word, hut must act it in dumb show, and not utter it in speech.' Thus they might agree together that the word was "prance," and they would imitate the prancing of horses. They would be met by a chorus of hisses, telling them they were wrong, and would retire to agree upon another word. They might then come in and draw an outline of France or imitate the throwing of dice to suggest the word "chance" and so on, until hitting upon "dance," they dance round and round and are greeted with the clapping of hands telling them they are right.s The other party then take their turn in going out, and guess the word chosen. Buzz.—The company seat themselves round the room and the master or mistress of the ceremonies—say the hostess— tells them to cry their number. So the first begins, one ; the second cries tiuo; and so on till seven comes, when he or she must cry " Euzz " ; eight to thirteen continue as before, but fourteen must cry "Buzz" and so on for every multiple of seven up to seventy, when " Buzz, buzz," must be used, and " Buzz, buzz, buzz," for seventy-seven. Everyone who neglects to cry "Buzz " at the multiple of seven or "Buzz, buzz," later on, must pay a forfeit. The game may be played with almost any number, as the crying of the figures may go round and round as long as desired, and eirors are pretty certain to be made, especially when more than one "buzz" is required. Bib=bob will amuse a large number of little folks. One or two cords must be stretched across the room, or from tree to tree m the open air, and little toys, apples, oranges, figs, sweetmeats, &c, may be hung to them by thread or small cord, not too close together. One of the children is to be blindfolded and given a little stick, with which he is to feel ins way for the "bib-bobs," or articles hung on the lines. 27 Gold Medals and other Awards.SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. When he has found one with the stick, he must endeavour fco^ seize it with his mouth, and when once he holds it firmly with the mouth, his eyes may be unbandaged and he may be_ allowed to unfasten his prize in triumph; then the next child is blindfolded and the game continues. The fingers are on no account to touch the "bib-bobs," and the time for each child to try to get one may be limited. The eager Bib-Bod. children watching the attempts may cry "hot" or "cold" as the blindfolded child approaches or recedes from one of the " bib-bobs," or a piano may be played slowly or fast for the same purpose. The Magic Bridge.—This is a pretty dance game. The children stand round in a ring, and if large, there may be four "bridges," i.e., two players join hands and form the bridge, under which the others pass. As the children stand around, hand-in-hand, the piano strikes up a merry, easy dance tune and the children begin to skip and dance round See smiling faces all aroundi SOME INDOOR GAMES. 431 to it, singing gaily all tlie time, "Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, tra-la-la," &c. When they have thus danced round several times the leader cries, Bridge One or Two, and the two children hold up their arms, and the two players opposite cross the circle, pass under the bridge, then one bears to the right, and the other to the left, and curving round, followed by the others, meet and form a fresh circle; then the second bridge opens and the children dance through it in a similar way, singing " Tra-la-la " all the time. It can be arranged that each couple The Magic Bkidqe. of children form "bridges" one after the other, their little feet kept constantly dancing over the floor until they are tired. The Planet Game.—In this the children imitate the sun and the planets. One with a golden cardboard crown on his head and with a paper marked " Sun," stands in the centre, hold- ing in his uplifted right hand a number of threads. Round him are chalked marks or circles of thread are placed on the floor, to indicate the paths of the planets round the sun. Each child has a similar paper showing the name of the planet represented. They then grasp the other end of the thread wherever SUNLIGHT SOAP is found.432 " SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. and run round the sun, each in his own orbit or circle. They should also turn on their feet as well as run round in their circle, showing how night and day are formed.

Then, without permitting your body to be seen, manoeuvre your hands as shown on next page.

" Forfeits."—Most people know how forfeits are re- deemed and know also some humorous or puzzling things which have to "be done by a person who has "forfeited" an article by an error in a game ; all kinds of things may, of course, be invented, but anything rough or rude, or that would give pain, should of course be avoided. We give a few here which perhaps may not be well known. The person who " cries " the forfeits may bow her face in a friend's lap so that she cannot see to whom the forfeited article belongs. The question is asked in the time-honoured phrase—" Here's a thing, and a very pretty thing, and what is to be done by the owner of this very pretty thing ? " [before he or she gets it back again]. The blindfolded person may ask whether the forfeit belongs to a lady or gentleman. 1. He must (says the r .acle) put one hand where the other cannot reach it! The desperate endeavours of the person to execute this puzzling manoeuvre excites much laughter unless be or she knows the answer—which is to place one hand on the elbow of the other arm. 2 and 3. Other redemptions of forfeits are puzzling, being due to the confusing grammatical construction of the order, thus—" Bite an inch off the poker " strictly means " bite an inch away from the poker;" so also—"Put two chairs back to back, take off your shoes, and jump over them." This instruction may be as puzzling to a young •lady who has to accomplish the feat as the biting " off the poker may be to a child who cannot possibly understand the puzzling order until explained; but the true grammatical meaning of course is that the shoes are to be jumped over, and not the chairs. 4 and 5. Blindfold the person and let him guess who touches him; he is at liberty to retain the hand that touches him if he can hold it. variation is to give the blindfolded person a spoonful of water, and he is to guess who has given it. , 6. To kiss rabbit fashion. The person who has to redeem the forfeit may select any one of the opposite sex; a piece of cotton is broken from a reel, the lady takes one end m her mouth and the gentleman the other end, and they have to mo'ulz the cotton until the kiss ensues. You can't do without soap!435 SOME INDOOR GAMES. 7. Blow a candle out blindfold. This often causes muck amusement; the blindfolded person is led to the table on which, the candl9 is placed, and often blows in quite the wrong direction. The candle should be placed sufficiently far from the person to prevent the face or hair being scorched. 8. A musical medley. If it be desired to redeem several forfeits at once, the owners of <he forfeited articles may be told to sing each a different song, and if, for instance, four persons be selected and each chooses a different "round," the effect of the different lines following after one another or clashing together may be very grotesque. A variation, of course, would be to instruct them to sing a glee or part song together, properly, or one after the other, each one his or her own song, or give a recitation. This might form an appro- priate close to the game of forfeits. 9. Three Signs.—The person stands with his, or her, face to the wall, while one of the opposite sex makes three signs behind, viz., of a pinch, or a kiss, or a box-on-the-ear, and he is to guess which of the three he would prefer. 10. Mention half a dozen flattering things to a lady or gentleman without the letter " 1" ; then you may say " Miss or Mr. So-and-So is pretty, handsome, entertaining, generous, good-tempered, good, upright, strong," &c.,. but such words as graceful, gallant, chivalrous, charitable, beautiful, &c, are not admissible, as they all contain the letter "1." 11. The Grecian Statue.— This is more suited for a gentle- man. He must stand on a chair, and the company, one after the other, may pose him, i.e., one may bend his arm into any position (awkward or not) ; another may turn up his head, with the chin in the air; a third may move out a foot, so that the unfortunate statue poses and balances on one leg. He may be made to kneel in a mock heroic attitude, as in "Ajax defying the lightning"; or the poses need not be always humorous. 12. Opportunity.—This is more suited for a lady. She must stand in the middle of the room and spell opportunity and then walk to her seat. If one or more gentlemen can reach her before she sits down they may claim a kiss. It will be seen that several of these forfeits may be taken as separate games, apart from " Forfeits." Why not get SUNLIGHT SOAP—the Best ?PUBLIC OPINION ON LIFEBUOY ROYAL DISINFECTANT SOAP.

We use it in our Turkish and private baths. It is a valuable health tonic. Bathers realize a healthy glow of the skin after the use of Lifebuoy Soap. It is also a powerful disinfectant, and is of great advantage as a sanitary agent. It has only to be tried to be appreciated. Yours faithfully, Jno. Imay (Manager). Prevents the Spread of Infectious Disease. Colne Road, Clacton-on-Sea. Dec. 11th, 1896. Gentlemen,—A case of scarlet fever occurred in the house some weeks ago, one of the visitors' children breaking down with it. By taking ordinary precautions, and the use of Lifebuoy Soap ad lib. for all domestic and toilet purposes, we were successful in confining the outbreak to the one person, although there were twenty- two persons in the house, twelve of these being children. This, I think, proves all, if not more, than you claim for it. Further, our baby, now six months old, has been daily washed with Lifebuoy Soap since born, and although very fat, has never had broken or rough skin. This is a conclusive proof of its purity and excellence. Yours faithfully, N. B. If you wish your linen to be as white as snow,Maintains the Body in Health. Twyford, Berks. March 31st, 1896.

SUNLIGHT » YEAR-BOOK. 438 Burner's Secret By A. CONAN DOYLE. {Specially written for the " Sunlight " Yeae-Book.) " T OOK here, Burger," said Kennedy, "I do wish that _Ly you would confide in me." The two famous students of Boman remains sat together in Kennedy's comfortable room overlooking the Corso. The night was cold, and they had both pulled up their chairs to the unsatisfactory Kalian stove which threw out a zone of stuffiness rather than of warmth. Outside under the bright winter stars lay the modern Borne, the long, double chain of the electric lamps, the brilliantly, lighted cafes, the rushing carriages, and the dense throng upon the footpaths. But inside, in the sumptuous chamber of the rich young English archseologist there was only old Borne to be seen. Cracked and time-worn friezes hung upon the walls, grey old busts of senators and soldiers with their fighting heads and their hard, cruel faces peered out from the corners. On the centre table, amidst a litter of inscriptions, fragments and ornaments, there stood the famous reconstruction by Kennedy of the Baths of Cara- calla, which excited such interest and admiration when it was exhibited in Berlin. Amphorae hung from the ceiling, and a litter of curiosities strewed the rich red Turkey carpet. And of them all there was not one which was not of the most unimpeachable authenticity, and of the utmost rarity and value; for Kennedy, though little more than thirty, had a European reputation in this particular branch of research; and was, moreover, provided with that long purse which either proves to be a fatal handicap to the student's energies, or, if his mind is still true to its purpose, gives him an enormous advantage in the race for fame. Kennedy had often been seduced by whim and pleasure from his studies, but his mind was an incisive one, capable of long and concentrated efforts which ended in sharp reactions of sensuous languor. His handsome Just a line to tell you SUNLIGHT SOAPBURGER'S SECRET. 43^ face, with its high, white forehead, its aggressive nose, and' its somewhat loose and sensual mouth, was a fair index of the compromise between strength and weakness in his nature. Of a very different type was his companion, Julius Burger. He came of a curious blend, a German father and an Italian mother, with the robust qualities of the North mingling strangely with the softer graces of the South. Blue Teutonic eyes lightened his sun-browned face, and above them rose a square, massive forehead, with a fringe of close yellow curls lying round it. His strong, firm jaw was clean-shaven, and his companion had frequently remarked how much it suggested those old Roman busts which peered out from the shadows in the comers of his chamber. Under its bluff German strength there lay always a suggestion of Italian subtlety, but the smile was so honest, and the eyes so frank, that one understood that this was only an indication of his ancestry, with no actual bearing upon his character. In age and in reputation he was on the same level as his English companion, but his life and his work had both been far more arduous. Twelve years before he had come as a poor student to Rome, and had lived ever since upon some small endowment for research which had been awarded to him by the Uni- versity of Bonn. Painfully, slowly and doggedly, with extraordinary tenacity and single - mindedness, he had climbed from rung to rung, of the ladder of fame until now he was a member of the Berlin Academy, and there was every reason to believe thai he would shortly be pro- moted to the Chair of the greatest of German Universities. But the singleness of purpose which had brought him to the same high level as the rich and brilliant Englishman, had caused him in everything outside their work to stand mnmtely below him. He had never found a pause in his studies m which to cultivate the social graces. It was on ]y when he spoke of his own subject that his face was Mied with life and soul. At other times he was silent and embarrassed, too conscious of his own limitations in larger subjeota^andJmp^W of that small talk which is cleans clothes and aImosTanythhTg~e^■ *40 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. the conventional refuge of those who have no thoughts to express. And yet for some years there had been an acquaintance- ship which appeared to be slowly ripening into a friendship between these two very different rivals. The base and origin of this lay in the fact that in their own studies each was the only one of the younger men who had knowledge and enthusiasm enough to properly appreciate the other. Their common interests and pursuits had brought them Prize Dogs and Poultry should beBURGER'S SECRET^ 44i together, and each had been attracted by the other's know- ledge. And then gradually something had been added to this. _ Kennedy had been amused by the frankness and Simplicity of his rival, while Burger in t turn had been fascinated by the brilliancy and vivacity which had made Kennedy such a favourite in Roman society. I say " had," because just at the moment the young Englishman was somewhat under a cloud. A love affair, the details of which had never quite come out, had indicated a heartlessness and callousness upon his part which shocked many of his friends. But in the bachelor circles of students and artists in which he preferred to move there is no very rigid code of honour m such matters, and though a head might be shaken or a pair of shoulders shrugged over the flight of two and the return of one, the general sentiment was probably one of curiosity and perhaps of envy rather than of reprobation " Look here, Burger," said Kennedy, looking hard at the placid face of his companion, "I do wish that you would confide m me." As he spoke he waved his hand in the direction of a ru* Which lay upon the floor. On the rug stood a long, shallow fruit basket of the light wicker-work which is used in the Oampana, and this was heaped with a litter of obiects, inscribed tiles, broken inscriptions, cracked mosaics, torn papyri rusty metal ornaments, which to the uninitiated might have seemed to have come straight from a dustman's biff, but which a specialist would have speedily recognised as unique of their kind.

Kennedy sat thinking with his fine forehead wrinkled and his fingers playing with his long, fair moustache. <( You have given yourself away, Burger 1 " said he at last. "Your words can only apply to one thing. You have dis- covered a new catacomb." " I had no doubt that you had already come to that con- clusion from an examination of these objects." " Well, they certainly appeared to indicate it, but your last remarks make it certain. There is no place except a catacomb which could contain so vast a store of relics 2,3 you describe." " Quite so. There is no mystery about that, I have discovered a new catacomb." "Where?" " Ah, that is my secret, my dear Kennedy. Suffice it that it is so situated that there is not one chance in a million of anyone else coming upon it. Its date is different from that of any known catacomb and it has been reserved for the burial of the highest Christians, so that the remains and the relics are quite different from anything which has ever been seen before. If I was not aware of your know- ledge and of your energy, my friend, I would not hesitate,1 under the pledge of secrecy, to tell you everything about it. But as it is I think that I must certainly prepare my own report of the matter before I expose myself to such formid- able competition." Kennedy loved his subject with a love which was almost a mania—a love which held him true to it, amidst all the distractions which come to a wealthy and dissipated young man He had ambition, but his ambition was secondary to his mere abstract joy and interest in everything which concerned the old life and history of the city. He yearned to see this new underworld which his companion had disco vgi^gcI "Look here, Burger," said he earnestly, "I assure yoil that you can trust me most implicitly in the matter.

"When did you ever ask me anything that I did not tell you? You remember, for example, my giving you the material for your paper about the temple of the Vestals." " Ah well, thai> was not a matter of much importance. If I were to question you upon some intimate thing would you give me an answer, I wonder ! This new catacomb is a very intimate thing to me, and I should certainly expect Some sign of confidence in return." "What you are driving at I cannot imagine," said the Englishman, " but if you mean that you will answer my question about the catacomb if I answer any question which you may put to me I can assure you that I will certainly do so." " Well, then," said Burger, leaning luxuriously back in his settee, and puffing a blue tree of cigar smoke into the air, " tell me all about your relations with Miss Mary |3aunderson." Kennedy sprang up in his chair and glared angrily at his impassive companion. " What the devil do you mean ?" he cried. " What sort of a question is this ? You may mean it as a joke, but you never made a worse one." " No, I don't mean it as a joke," said Burger, simply, " I am really rather interested in the details of the matter. I don't know much about the world and women and social life and that sort of thing, and such an incident has the fascination of the unknown for me. I know you, and I knew her by sight—I had even spoken to her once or twice. I should very much like to hear from your own lips exactly what it was which occurred between you." " I won't tell you a word." " That's all right. It was only my whim to see if you would give up a secret as easily as you expected me to give up my secret of the new catacomb. You wouldn't, and 1 didn't expect you to. But why should you expect other- wise of me ? There's Saint John's clock striking ten. It is quite time that I was going home."

But if you did not love her why should you make this great scandal which has damaged you and ruined her ? " Kennedy looked moodily into the red eye of the stove. " That's a logical way of looking at it, certainly," said he. " Love is a big word and it represents a good many different shades of feeling. I liked her and—well, you say you've seen her—you know how charming she could look. But still I am willing to admit, looking back, that I could never have really loved her." " Then, my dear Kennedy, why did you do it ?" _ _ ^ " The adventure of the thing had a great deal to do with.it.' " What! You are so fond of adventures !" " Where would the variety of life be without them. It was for an adventure that I first began to pay my attentions to her I've chased a good deal of'game in my time, but there's no chase like that of a pretty woman. There was the piquant difficulty of it also, for, as she was the com- panion of Lady Emily Eood, it was almost impossible to see her alone. On the top of all the other obstacles which attracted me, I learned from her own lips very early m the proceedings that she was engaged." "MeinGott! To whom?" " She mentioned no names." " I do not think that anyone knows that. So that made the adventure more alluring, did it?

" If he had been the better man she would not have deserted him. Let's drop the subject, for I have had enough of it! " "Only one other thing. How did you get rid of her in three weeks ? " " Well, we had both cooled down a bit, you understand. She absolutely refused, under any circumstances, to come back to face the people she had known in Kome. Now}> of course, Eome is necessary to me, and I was already pining to be back at my work—so there was one obvious cause of separation. Then, again, her old father turned up at the hotel in London, and there was a scene, and the whole thing became so unpleasant that really—though I missed her dreadfully at first—I was very glad to slip out of it. Now, I rely upon you not to repeat anything of what I have said." ^ . ., " My dear Kennedy, I should not dream of repeating it.

I think it would be best for us to meet at the Gate of the Appian Way at midnight. I must go back to my lodgings for the matches and candles and things." " All right, Burger ! I think it is very kind of you to let me into this secret, and I promise you that I will write nothing about it until you have published your report. Good-bye for the present! You will find me at the Gate at twelve." The cold, clear air was filled with the musical chimes from that city of clocks as Burger, wrapped in an Italian overcoat, with a lantern hanging from his hand, walked up to the rendezvous. Kennedy stepped out of the shadow to meet him,. "You are ardent in work as well as in love !" said the German, laughing. " Yes, rhave been waiting here for nearly half an hour." "I hope you left no clue as to where we were going." " Not such a fool! By Jove, I am chilled to the bone f Come on, Burger, let us warm ourselves by a spurt of hard walking." Their footsteps sounded loud and crisp upon the rough stone paving of the disappointing road which is all that is left of the most famous highway of the world. A peasant or two going home from the wine-shop, and a few carts of country produce coming up to Eome, were the only things which they met. They swung along, with the huge tombs looming up through'the darkness upon each side of them, until they had come as far as the Catacombs of St. Calixtus' and saw against a rising moon the great circular bastion of Cecilia Metella in front of them. Then Burger stonped with his hand to his side. "Your legs are longer than mine, and you are more accustomed to walking,'' said he, laughing. < < I think that the place where we turn off is somewhere here. Yes, this is it, round the corner of the trattoria. Now, it is a very narrow path, so perhaps I had better go in front and you can follow." He had lit his lantern and by its light they were enabled the home is always bright. o450 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. to follow a narrow and devious track which wound across the marshes of the Campaiia. The great Aqueduct of old Home lay like a monstrous caterpillar across the moonlit landscape, and their road led them under one of its huge arches and past the circle of crumbling bricks which marks the old arena. At last Burger stopped at a solitary wooden cowhouse, and he drew a key from his pocket. "Surely your catacomb is not inside a house!" cried Kennedy. " The entrance to it is. That is just the safeguard which we have against anyone else discovering it." u Does the proprietor know of it?" " Not he. He had found one or two objects which made me almost certain that his house was built on the entrance to such a place. So I rented it from him, and did my excavations for myself. Come in, and shut the door behind you." It was a long, empty building, with the mangers of the cows along one wall. Burger put his lantern down on the ground, and shaded its light in all directions save one by draping his overcoat round it. •' It might excite remark if anyone saw a light in this lonely place," said he. "Just help me to move this boarding!" The flooring was loose in the corner, and plank by plank the two savants raised it and leaned it against the wall. Below there was a square aperture and a stair of old stone steps which led away down into the bowels of the earth. "Be careful!" cried Burger, as Kennedy in his impatience hurried down them. " It is a perfect rabbit's warren below, and if you were once to lose your way there the chances would be a hundred to one against your ever coming out again. Wait until I bring the light." "How do you find your own way if it is so complicated?" "I had some very narrow escapes at first but I have gradually learned to go about. There is a certain system to it, but it is one which a lost man, if he were in the dark, could not possibly find out. Even now I always spin out a ball of string behind me when I am going far into the A friend in need is a friend indeed—451 BURGER'S SECRET. catacomb. You can see for yourself that it is difficult, but every one of these passages divide and subdivide a dozen times before you go a hundred yards." They had descended some twenty feet from the level of the byre, and they were standing now in a, square chamber cut out of the soft tufa. • The lantern cast a flickering light, bright below and dim above, over the cracked brown walls. In every direction were the black openings of passages which radiated from this common centre. " 1 WAIT UNTIL I BEING THE LIGHT.' " ll>, 450. "I want you to follow me closely, my friend," said Burger. " Do not loiter to look at anything upon the way, for the place to which I will take you contains all that you can see, and more. It will save time for us to go there direct." He led the way down one of the corridors and the SUWGHT SOAP is a friend in need. TT453 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. Englishman followed closely at his heels. ' Every now and then the passage bifurcated, but Burger was evidently following some secret marks of his own, for he neither stopped nor hesitated. Everywhere along the walls, packed like the berths upon an emigrant ship, lay the Christians of old Eome. The yellow light flickered over the shrivelled features of the mummies, and gleamed upon rounded skulls and long, white armbones crossed over fleshless chests. And everywhere as he passed Kennedy looked with wistful eyes upon inscriptions, funeral vessels, pictures, vestments, utensils, all lying as pious hands had placed them so many centuries ago. It was apparent to him even in those hurried, passing glances that this was the earliest and finest of the catacombs, containing such a storehouse of Eoman remains as had never before come at one time under the observation of the student. " What would happen if the light went out ? " he asked, as they hurried onwards. "I have a spare candle and a box of matches in my pocket. By the way, Kennedy, have you any matches ? " " No, you had better give me some." " Oh, that is all right. There is no chance of our separating." " How far are we going ? It seems to me that we have walked at least a quarter of a mile." " More than that, I think. There is really no limit to the tombs—at least I have never been able to find any. This is a very difficult place, so I think that I will use our ball of string." He fastened one end of it to a projecting stone and he carried the coil in the breast of his coat, paying it out as he advanced. Kennedy saw that it was no unnecessary precaution, for the passages had become more complex and tortuous than ever, with a perfect network of intersecting corridors.. But these all ended in one large circular hall with a square pedestal of tufa topped with a slab of marble at one end of it. " By Jove !" cried Kennedy in an ecstaey, as Burger swung his lantern over the marble. "It is a Christian SUNLIGHT SOAP does its workBURGER'S SECRET. 453 altar—probably the first one in existence. Here is the little consecration cross cut upon the corner of ib. No doubt this circular space was used as a church." "Precisely," said Burger; "if I had more time I should like to show you all the bodies which are buried in these niches upon the walls, for they are the early popes and bishops of the Church, with their mitres, their croziers and full canonicals. Go over to that one and look at it!" " ' BY. JOVE ! ' CRIED KENNEDY." IP- Kennedy went across, and stared at the ghastly head which lay loosely on the shredded and mouldering mitre. " This is most interesting," said he, and his voice seemed to boom against the concave vault. " As far as my experi- ence goes it is unique. Bring the lantern over, Burger, for I want to see them all." But the German had strolled away and was standing in quickly, thoroughly and well.454 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. the middle of a yellow circle of light at the other side of the hall. "Do you know how many wrong turnings there are between this and the stairs ?" he asked. " There are over two thousand. No doubt it was one of the means of protection which the Christians adopted. The odds are two thousand to one against a man getting out, even if he had a light, but if he were in the dark it would, of course, be far more difficult." " So I should think." "And the darkness is something dreadful. I tried it once for an experiment. Let us try it again ! " He stooped to the lantern and in an instant it was as if an invisible hand was squeezed tightly over each of Kennedy's eyes. Never had he known what such darkness was. It seemed to press upon him and to smother him. It was a solid obstacle against which the body shrank from advancing. He put his hands out to push it back from him. "That will do, Burger," said he, "let's have the light again." But his companion began to laugh, and in that circular room the sound seemed to come from every side at onco. " You seem uneasy, friend Kennedy," said he. " Go on, man, light the candle !" said Kennedy, im- patiently. " It's very strange, Kennedy, but I could not in the least tell by the sound in which direction you stand. Could you tell where I am?" " No, you seem to be on every side of me." " If it were not for this string which I hold in my hand I should not have a notion which way to go." KI daresay not. Strike a light, man, and have an end cf ihirj nonsense."

But you need not hurry, for you have plenty of time, and when you halt for a rest now and then I should like you just to think of Miss Mary Saunderson, and whether you treated her quite fairly." " You devil, what do you mean ?" roared Kennedy. He was running about in little circles and clasping at the solid blackness with both hands. " Good-bye," said the mocking voice, and it was already at some distance. " I really do not think, Kennedy, even by your own showing that you did the right thing by that girl. There was only one little thing which you appeared not to know, and I can supply it. Miss Saunderson was engaged to a poor, ungainly devil of a student and his name was Julius Burger." SUNLIGHT SOAP, Highest Award, Chicago, 1893."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 455 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Paris, 1889. There was a rustle somewhere, the vague sound of a foot striking a stone and then there fell silence upon that old Christian church—a stagnant, heavy silence which closed round Kennedy and shut him in like water round a drowning man. * * # # *. Some two months afterwards the following paragraph made the round of the European Press. "One of the most interesting discoveries of recent years is that of the new catacomb in Eome, which lies some distance to the east of the well-known vaults of St. Calixtus. The finding of this important burial-place, which is exceedingly rich in most interesting early Christian remains, is due to the energy and sagacity of Dr. Julius Burger, the young German specialist, who is rapidly taking the first place as an authority upon ancient Eome. Although the first to publish his discovery, it appears that a less fortunate adventurer had anticipated Dr. Burger. Some months ago Mr. Kennedy, the well-known English student, disappeared suddenly from his rooms in the Corso, and it was conjectured that his association with a recent scandal had driven him to leave Eome. It appears now that he had in reality fallen a victim to that fervid love of archaeology which had raised him to a distinguished place among living scholars. His body was discovered in the heart of the new catacomb, and it was evident from the condition of his feet and boots that he had tramped for days through the tortuous corridors which make these sub- terranean tombs so dangerous to explorers. The deceased gentleman had, with inexplicable rashness, made his way into this labyrinth without, as far as can be discovered, taking with him either candles or matches, so that his sad fate was the natural result of his own temerity. What makes the matter more painful is that Dr. Julius Burger was an intimate friend of the deceased. His joy at the extraordinary find which he has been so fortunate as to make has been greatly marred by the terrible fate of hUs comrade and fellow-worker."PORT SUNLIGHT, 457 port Sunlight The commercial success of British manufacturers is a matter not only of general but actually of Imperial interest. In modern times the importance to nations of the success of their trade is hardly inferior to that of their arms. But socially? Alas, too often the conditions under which the commercial products of Great Britain are produced are so - . t ' View from the Dell, Port Sunlight. deplorable as to shame those who boast of their country's greatness. Happily this is not so at Port Sunlight. The conditions under which the soap is produced are such as to make the lives of the producers worth living. Close to Birkenhead, and on the Cheshire side of the Mersey, stands the busy and prosperous settlement known as Tort Sunlight. Very little over ten years ago the place was mere grazing land, and now, by the simple process of a little time, accompanied by steady perseverance.

Lever Brothers, Limited, manufacturers of Sunlight Soap. The village of Port Sunlight, which surrounds the works, is a model one; ita sanitary arrangements are perfect, the beauty of its surround- ings unique, and the cottages themselves are every one of them built with an eye to the artistic, both in grouping and design. In the beginning of 1886, Messrs. Lever Brothers commenced their soap works at Warrington, when the capacity of the works was twenty tons of soap per week. Now, in 1897, the Works at Port Sunlight have a capacity of 2,400 tons per week, and no less than 2,200 persons are engaged in this industrial undertaking in various capacities and in all parts of the world. To enter for a few minutes into the life of this busy hive of workers, the reader is asked to imagine himself or herself to be one of the frequent parties of visitors who present them- selves at the doors of the office asking to be shown over the works and village. The office is larger and handsomer than many a well-known bank, and a busy tribe of clerks are at work upon ponderous ledgers. The private rooms of the beads of the firm run down each side, and their walls are adorned with both the originals and coloured reproductions of many a picture that has graced the "line" of the Academy, pictures by artists of acknowledged celebrity which are now used to illustrate the merits of Sunlight and Lifebuoy Soaps. Passing through the office, we enter the great Printing Department, which is admirably lighted and well ventilated. Here are printing machines of all sorts and conditions for printing all kinds of matter, from box labels to pamphlets, from soap wrappers to the "Port Sunlight Monthly Journal," a neatly got up and beautifully printed and illus- trated publication of 32 pages and wrapper, to which the employes contribute topical articles, and in which are recorded, month by month, the doing3 of the Village Council and the various clubs, classes and societies which make up the social life of Port Sunlight village. The machines in this depart- ment are particularly interesting. There is one great rotary machine, from Paris, which turns out twenty-four thousand 32-page (Royal) pamphlets per hour. Another rotary machine459 PORT SUNLIGHT. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Mai, Ottawa, S893. turns out Sunlight Soap wrappers at the rate of 80,000 wrappers per hour. Leaving this great room, we pass to the Laboratory. Here we find a number of scientific-looking gentlemen, View in Port Sunlight Village. surrounded with retorts, bottles, cru- cibles, and all the expert's paraphernalia for the great business of "testing."' Here samples from every vat of all the soaps manufactured by the Company are tested three timesy once during boiling, once after boiling, and again after being cooled. And here the glycerine manufactured by Messrs. Lever Brothers, Limited, is also tested, and sent out so pure that it will stand all the various tests insti- tuted by the British Pharmacopoeia for ascertaining tho purity of glycerine. Passing from the Laboratories, we . come to the Card Box-making Eooms, where hundreds of thoiisands of the special compact boxes, with which we are all familiar when they are filled with their three stout double tablets of Sunlight or Lifebuoy Soap, are turned out with the most marvellous speed and precision by a crowd of cheerful girls. The great workshop where this branch of the work iff carried on has a special feature of interest, which is seen in the Soap Stamping Department also. It is a sort of little tramway track on which run broad bands between the rows of machines at which the girls stand making the boxes.SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 460 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Kimberley, 1892. These bands are always gliding noiselessly along, and, as tliey pass, the workers pile on them the finished boxes, which are then carried on to the department where other hands are deftly wrapping up the completed tablets of soap. By means of this ingenious and automatic little tramway, much time and labour is saved, In the joiners' shop and wood box-making factories, to which our next move is made, the value of the principle of the division of labour is again seen. The wood comes into the department in pieces, long strips for tops, bottoms and sides, short pieces for ends. These are applied to the machines by lads with the most astonishing dexterity. Each machine drives in seven nails at a blow, the nails being fed by magnets. Before one has time almost to see what is being done, the box is finished and thrown aside. The effect is magical, but very practical, for 16,000 of these boxes can be produced in a day ! The engine-house is a "fearful and wonderful" depart- ment, and bewildering to the mind unfamiliar with machinery. It is the great heart of the factory, as it were, with its huge and fearsome wheel, which distributes "motive power" to the distant limb of steel and iron as the heart distributes blood to the furthest members of the body. It has its beauty, too, as well as its strength; the black-and-white mosaic of the floor is a graceful touch that relieves the sombreness of the vast engines. We can but glance at the timber stores, where wood, chiefly from Norway, lies stacked in symmetrical piles; at the great wharf, and the docks, where steamers lie to carry the Sunlight merchandise to the uttermost parts of the earth; at the huge cotton-seed warehouse, and the red- painted circular oil tanks, which look like the great gas-holders one sees at a gasworks; and at the warehouse, where the stacks of soap bars vould suggest soap enough to wash the nation for a score of years. Then we turn to the Tower which surmounts the factory proper, where the soap itself is actually made. We mount several flights of steps and come out on a belvedere, from which a prospect greets us that made it worth the labour of climbing so many steps. "We see, spread out beneath us, the whole of Port Sunlight. Ib one hundred and seventy-three and a half acres lie at our feet, bathed in the glowing461 PORT SUNLIGHT. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Ghent, 1889. sunshine; the factory and a large part of the buildings belonging to it, and many of the cottages of its village, are built of red brick, hence the prospect is bright and cheer- ful. Then we descend to homely prose again, and enter the Soap Boiling Booms. These are much too vast to be correctly called rooms—they are rather wide and lofty galleries, and their vastness can be gauged from the fact that they contain 84 pans, each capable of containing 60 tons of liquid soap! In them the soap is seething sullenly. It does not boil up briskly, but appears to work underneath, only giving vent to its feelings by an occasional heave or bubble^ and reminds one of the hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park. One might fancy a huge hasty pudding was cooking for a party of Jack's giants. A striking circumstance is that there is no unpleasant smell. One generally associates soap-boiling with an atmosphere that is vilely odorous, and there can be no stronger evidence of the purity that does exist in the materials of which Sunlight Soap is made than the fact that the visitors can hang over these great tanks and curiously inspect their con- tents without being I j&L reminded by the /j| olfactory senses that fat is boiling below. But there are fats and fats ; besides, in the man uf actur e of Sunlight Soap, vegetable oil is very U largely used, oil such as is used in ' thousands of kitchens for cooking purposes, and there- fore it is pure and fragrant. After the materials are boiled, they are passed below into another room for " cool- ing." The cooling process is done in "frames," i.e., great open-topped iron boxes, into which the soap is .1 Post an Telegraph O.fice. 1 ^Wj/l463 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. SUNUGliTsOAP, Gold Medal, Lyons, 1894. conveyed by spouts from above. When cold, the sides of the boxes are opened, and the massive, smooth blocks of soap are cut by machinery into slabs. These are then cut into bars by curious machines worked each by two men. The final processes are the stamping, -wrapping, and packing. The stamping is very interesting. Some of it is done by machines, which receive the bars at one end and pour them out at the other in the familiar, neat double- tablet, and some is done by boys, who take each block off the little tramline running down the room, as already described, and putting it under a stamping machine, stamp each block and pass it to the girls who wrap and pack it. This is a very brief description of the way in which Sunlight and Lifebuoy Soaps are made, for Lifebuoy Soap is precisely the same as Sctnlight Soap, except that it is impregnated with a very large percentage of carbolic acid, so that it becomes a disinfecting soap of the highest class, as is proved by the testimony, after careful analysis, of Dr. Ka??l Enoch, of Hamburg. Foreign and Colonial Expansion. The soaps manufactured by Lever Brothers, Limited, are exported to aU parts of the North and South American Continents, to every country in Europe, to India, Burmah, and Ceylon, to Turkey-in-Europe, as well as Turkey-in-Asia, Persia, China, Arabia, Siam, Japan, the Straits Settlements, Egypt, Syria, every part of Africa, including the German and Portuguese Colonies on the Dark Continent, the Pacific, Canary, and Falkland Islands, Cyprus, Mauritius, Mozambique, New Zealand and Australia. The head office in the last-named Continent is in Sydney, and all the Australian Colonies are worked from there. There are offices in Toronto for the working of Canada, in New York for the working of the U.S.A., and in Hamburg, Brussels and Eotterdam, but every tablet of soap bo id m at this great array of countries is made in Port Sunlight, on the JlJr Mersey. The sight of the wrappers printed m thirty different languages would be interesting to a philologist but it is rather terrifying to the ignorant-a Sunlight Soap wrapper in Arabic is a sight surely worthy oi our progressive century! . -463 PORT SUNLIGHT. At the present moment Messrs.

[ river. This ^ is one of the (open) secrets why Sun- light Soap 1 Visw in Port Sunlight Village. possesses a fragrance quite apart from the mere addition of scent, which makes j.t so welcome everywhere. The present capacity of the mill is easily 200 tons daily, and, notwithstanding labour-saving devices, the mill employs no less than 150 hands, and is pronounced by competent judges, who have given it care- ful inspection, the best equipped mill in the southern world. Oil mills for the manufacture of cocoa-nut oil have also been built by Messrs. Lever Brothers, Limited, on the rugged shores of White Bay, Balmain, Sydney,, and here again an industry has been established which gives*every proof of being a great com- mercial success. Like their companions in Yicksburg, the Sydney Oil Mills have been erected on the most modern principles, and the machinery is all of the latest descrip- tion. The electric light is also installed, and in the boiler- house there are two very fine specimens of marine boilers. To give an idea of the capacity of the Sydney Oil Mills, it may be mentioned in connection with them that immediately adjacent to the wharf are two oil tanks, no less than 25 foot in diameter each, for the storage of oil as it ia manufactured and ready for transhipment to Port Sunlight. SUNLIGHT SOAP, less labour, greater comfort."SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 464 SUNLIGHT SOAP A Nineteenth-Century Industrial Community. And now let us return to Port Sunlight, look at the workers, and take a walk through the village. If ever a village deserved the title of "model" this one does, for every- thing seems to be planned to relieve the tedium of life. First of all we have the houses; when those now being erected are finished there will be over 400 of them. Correctly speaking they should be called " old English " cottages, they are entirely unlike the structures that rise to one's mental vision when "workmen's dwellings" are spoken of. Each cottage is planned for a family's occupation, and no cottage contains less than three bed-rooms, and every one, with the exception of three or four, contains a bath-room with water laid on ! Here are pictures of some of the cottages. Outside, some are " old English," with lattice windows and solid oak doors, reminding one exactly of that bit of "old London" still to be seen at Holborn bars. Inside we have bath-rooms, Wood Street, Port Sunlight windows that open freely, gas, and hot and cold water laid on, good drainage, and a good scullery, and well-paved back yard. Two of the houses at the end of the village are an465 PORT SUNLIGHT. exact reproduction of Shakespeare's "birthplace at Stratford-on- Avon. But the immortal William would not recognise his birthplace, for modern ideas have made the interior very different from that on which he opened his eyes. And the rents ? For 3s. a week there are cottages with a large kitchen, scullery, three bedrooms and bath-room; and there are no taxes at all, net even for water. For 5s. a week there are houses as above, but with a parlour and extra bedrooms; and there are a few larger houses for the heads of the departments. The broad roads are planted, like boulevards, with elm and chestnut trees. There are some fine old oak trees, too. Within sight of most of the houses are the " allotment" gardens, for which the demand among the Port Sunlight workmen is greater than the supply, and, to the thinking of the present scribe, theso gardens form one of the sunniest features of the Sunlight village. About eight rods of ground go to a garden, and the rent required is the sum of one shilling a year. Besides, the firm provides the gardens with water-taps. Happy gardeners, to have water "laid on" even at the roots of your cabbages. An "eight hours' day" is the rule of Port Sunlight. Work begins at seven and stops at five, with an hour and a half for meals. There is a long evening therefore for gardening. But this is only one of the forms of recreation which these people can turn to ; there are many others, and they, as well as the gardens, are managed by The Village Council. Tastes of all kinds—grave and gay, musical, athletip, dramatic, artistic, studious—are catered for, so that there is a chance for all to develop whatever inherent talents they may have; and the Village Council, chosen from among them- selves, administers the affairs of the community, as the Parliament at Westminster directs the affairs of the nation of which Port Sunlight is a part. The Gladstone Hall stands near the entrance to the works. Opened in 1891, by the Eight Hon. W. E. Gladstone, it is the centre of Dramatic Entertainments, and a good deal more beside?.

Alongside of the Lecture Eoom runs a great kitchen, with ample arrangements for heating and cooking, and here all classes of employes are pro- vided for.

We can barely mention the men's club, an old-English structure, with its wide bowling-green, crowded with players, and standing near the quaint village shop, with its old-world "sign" hanging over the door—the reading-room, where, as we pass, we see laces half-hidden in the daily papers-and the billiard-room from which comes the cheerful << click » of the ivory balls-for we must give our remaining fragment of space to an ^te^f trio-the women, girls, and^hildrenof Fort Sunlight. Among467 PORT SUNLIGHT. the buildings which, specially strike the visitor's eye as he drives into the Sunlight domain, is a handsome block with a fine light belvedere spire embellished with a handsome clock over an arched doorway. These are the schools, which were opened in the summer of 1896, and they face the bridge which spans the main roadway, in the centre of the dell which forms the park. They accommodate 500 children, who here receive, all free, a sound education. The schools are built on the most approved modern principles, are very lofty looking, indeed, like a handsome church inside as well as out. A central hall is so arranged that it can be used for religious services. Leaving the schools, a minute's walk brings us to the Girls' "Institute." Connected with the Girls' Institute, is a Sewing Class, numbering eighty members. The girls buy materials, by paying weekly instalments, and learn to cut out and make their own clothing. There are also Technical Education Classes, embracing the teaching of Cookery, Ambulance, Dressmaking, Shorthand, etc., etc. One shilling (supple- mented, however, by 3s. from the firm) pays for a course of twelve lessons in any of these classes. A Girls' Restaurant has been fitted up by the firm, in which hot dinners at rates of Id. to 4d. are served at the dinner hour. A Eeading Eoom is provided for the girls (subscription, Is. per annum), and is well stocked with papers. As we finish our tour of inspection, the whole atmosphere of the quiet village strikes one as peaceful. Work is over, and a spirit of quiet seems to brood over the village. Good, food, healthy occupation, pleasant surroundings, and reasonable recreations, are better than any legislation for making a happy and prosperous nation, and all these are provided for the great army of workers wTi^qo daily business it is, in one way or the other, to help m uae nitiuulacture of fou^Liam and Life- buoy Soaps. makes light work of a heavy wash.468 " SUNLIGHT " YEARBOOK.

Sunltgbt Corner FOR THE UTTLE ONES. HOW LITTLE FOLKS MAY HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR ! One way to be happy is to ba busy: and if our little efforts bring success, and our success brings a reward, is not the happiness threefold ? HAPPINESS IN TRE EFFORT. ' HAPPINESS IN THE SUCCESS. HAPPINESS IN THE REWARD. A short time ago we offered prizes for competition to girls and boys under fourteen years of age, and our experience of the hapi iness of the successful little folks induces us to offer to tbe little readers of the " Sunlight Year Book " for competition a series of PRIZES AMOUNTING TO ;3100. The following letter from a little friend shews what a little boy or SUNLIGHT SOAP is made of pure materialsCOMPETITIONS. 473 girl can do to bring happiness, not only to himself or herself, but to make others at home happy. "From Harold George, " Riverdale, " Rock Park, Eock Ferry. . " September 10th, 1897. ' Cf Dear Sunlight,—What a jolly man you are, to offer such fineprizea to us girls and boys ! When I read your paper I danced with delight, and I read over and over and over again every Rule very, very carefully, that 1 might follow each one just as you gave it. "One morning.when Mamma had turned out heaps and heaps of clothes for the wash, I slipped in amongst them, and I said, ' Mamma, did you ever try Sunlight Soap?' Dear Mamma was awfully hurried, but she took time to explain to me her many troubles with many soaps ; but she had never tried Sunlight. Don't you think it was kind of her to tell me all this, and those heaps of clothes lying there waiting ? I do hope you have a Mamma like I have, to tell you things you don't know. But I must not forget what followed. ' Mamma,' I said, ' do please, try Sunlight Soap, just this once, to please me.' I was delighted when i-he said, ' yes,' and allowed me to go my very self for one of your beautiful .tablets. Afterwards I weDt off to school, as happy as happy could be. j " I hurried home that day from school, and who could believe it, there was Mammadressed and as she said,' ready to take her own little Sunlight out for a little walk !' Where was the washing ? Mamma had said she would not have done that night till seven o'clock 1 Dear Sunlight, I thought of you, so very happy amongst your many darling watches, tick, tick, ticking away so prettily—and not one for little me. " At last I ventured to ask Mamma about the washing. Oh. Sunlight, you jolly man the washing was all done and I did not know it. And j.ust guess how it was done so early : Mamma had read on your i wrapper the directions : 'The Sunlight Way of Washing,' and she did just exactly as your wrapper told her to do with Sunlight Soap. After hardly a rub and never a boil, she lifted out the clothes one by one from the wash-tub "and only think of it: Sunlight Soap had done the work, and Mamma had only to hang the clothes up to dry and there they were All as clean as a new pin. " Do you know, dear Sunlight, I can't tell you how very, very glad I am now for Mamma's sake alone, because she says ' Washing will be a real pleasure to her after this.' " Now, dear Sunlight, the man with the prizes, this is my story of the Sunlight washing, and, honour bright, no one helped me to write it. " Dear Sunlight, I do want a watch so much. I should so love to hear the dear little thine: tick, tick, tick-my very, very, own. for the sake of quality.474 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. I hav9 really done my double best to get it and I do hope one of the darling watches will come to " Little Mb. " P.S.—Sunlight, you dear, dear man, please do hurry up and let ma know, quick, quick, about the prizes, and I Bhall send you forty thousand thanks, all to yourself, when the watch comes." We certify that this letter was written unaided by the boy whose name is at the toe of it, and that he is under 14 tears of age. (Signed) Mrs. George and Miss S., Teacher, ■ Sunland Schools, Brighthome. NOW FOR THE £100 IN PRIZES. Girls and Boys under Fourteen Years of Age only may enter for these prizes. You may do as Harold George did, ask your mother or guardian to try Sunlight Soap, if it be not already used in your home; for why should you not make those you love thus happy without expecting any other reward than the knowledge that you have made others bappy ? We are not, however, offering any prizes for that. We offer these prizes to the girls and boys under fourteen years of age, who shall send us the be3t letter, describing- How I made Mother Happy. If you live with a guardian and not with your mother, then describe How I made my Guardian Happy. Begin your letter with your name, your address in full, the date and then, " Dear Sunlight." , , nn. Write as neatly as you can, without help from anyone, and do no« copy the wording of our specimen letter: we prefer your own words. If you wish you may say whether or not Sunlight Soap is used in your home. If Sunlight Soap be used at home, we Bhall know that it is a home happy in one respect. Do not let your letter exceed 500 words, but it may be as short as you please. Write on ordinary letter paper, on one side only of the paper. At the end of your letter write— We certify that this letter was written, unaided, BY THE BOY (OR GIRL) WHOSE NAME IS WRITTEN AT THE HEAD, AND HE (OR SE3) IS UNDER 14 YEARS OF AGE.
